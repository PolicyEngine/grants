Primary stakeholders: Low-income individuals and families accessing benefits through navigation toolsâ€”people earning below living wage, experiencing economic insecurity, navigating SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, childcare subsidies, energy assistance, and other safety net programs.

Demographics: Predominantly women (primary caregivers, single parents), communities of color disproportionately reliant on safety net programs, immigrants accessing programs without citizenship requirements, people with disabilities navigating complex eligibility rules, working families facing benefit cliffs.

Intermediaries: Benefit navigation tools (MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition) serving these populations. Case workers, community organizations, legal aid providers.
