**Who: Stakeholder Definition**

Primary stakeholders: Low-income individuals and families accessing benefits through navigation tools—people earning below living wage, experiencing economic insecurity, navigating SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, childcare subsidies, energy assistance, and other safety net programs.

Demographics: Predominantly women (primary caregivers, single parents), communities of color disproportionately reliant on safety net programs, immigrants accessing programs without citizenship requirements, people with disabilities navigating complex eligibility rules, working families facing benefit cliffs.

Intermediaries: Benefit navigation tools (MyFriendBen, Starlight, Amplifi, Student Basic Needs Coalition) serving these populations. Case workers, community organizations, legal aid providers.

**How Many: Scale and Reach**

Six-month pilot: Infrastructure serving 100,000+ existing users across PolicyEngine API partners (MyFriendBen, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, Amplifi).

Year 2: Expanded coverage enables partners to reach 250,000-500,000 users as faster encoding unlocks previously inaccessible programs.

Long-term potential: PolicyEngine API is open-source infrastructure. Anyone building benefit navigation tools can use it. As coverage expands through AI acceleration, potential reach is millions—every benefit navigator in the U.S. can leverage faster, more comprehensive rules-as-code.

**What Impact: Specific Outcomes and Scale**

**The Infrastructure Leverage Argument:**

GitLab could fund 10 individual benefit navigators to expand their coverage. OR fund the ONE calculation engine ALL navigators depend on. PolicyEngine powers MyFriendBen (50K users), Starlight (credit union members), Student Basic Needs Coalition (college students), Amplifi (benefit navigation), and future partners. Each AI improvement multiplies across the entire ecosystem.

When we encode California EITC faster, every navigator can immediately offer it. When stochastic imputation reduces data collection, every tool's completion rate improves. Infrastructure investment has multiplicative impact—one grant dollar improves services for hundreds of thousands of people across multiple platforms.

PolicyEngine is infrastructure, but infrastructure with massive leverage:

Direct infrastructure improvements:
- Encoding speed: 5-10× faster program coverage (from 40-80 hours to 10-15 hours per program)
- Coverage expansion: 20-30 new benefit programs in 6 months (vs. 5-10 baseline)
- API performance: 50% latency reduction through ML prediction caching
- Accessibility: Benefit range estimates with 40% less required user data (enabling more people to get estimates)

Downstream economic impact through partners:

MyFriendBen currently serves 50,000+ users. They're constrained by PolicyEngine coverage—when we don't have a program encoded, they can't help users access it. Faster AI encoding directly removes this constraint.

Starlight partners with credit unions serving low-income members. Their benefit prediction depends on PolicyEngine calculations. Stochastic imputation enables them to provide estimates when members have incomplete financial data, expanding their reach.

Student Basic Needs Coalition uses PolicyEngine for SNAP calculations serving college students. Faster encoding of state-specific variations helps them serve more campuses.

**ROI Calculation (Specific Programs, Real Numbers):**

Target programs for AI encoding (based on partner requests):
- California EITC: 3M eligible, $1.7B annual, avg $400/recipient - Partners estimate 25K new users = $10M
- Texas/Florida childcare subsidies: Partners serve 15K families, avg $6K/year = $90M + wage preservation
- 5 state energy assistance programs: 10K households × $800 avg = $8M
- State rental assistance (NY, PA, OH): 8K households × $2K = $16M
- Additional state TANF/SNAP variations: 15K users × $1.2K = $18M

Total conservative: $150M in benefits accessed from 20 programs encoded with AI assistance.

ROI: $150M ÷ $250K = 600× return

Wage preservation calculation (childcare subsidy example):
- Texas/Florida childcare enables 8,000 parents to retain employment
- Average $28K annual wages (BLS data for sectors childcare enables: retail, food service, healthcare support)
- 8,000 × $28K = $224M in annual wages preserved
- ROI: 900×

Infrastructure leverage is real: Every navigator improvement helps 100,000+ existing users PLUS every future user across ALL platforms. One investment, unlimited multiplication.

**Measurement:**

Partner metrics: Track user growth in AI-enabled programs, engagement rates, reported benefits accessed.

Infrastructure metrics: Programs encoded per month, encoding time reduction, API latency, accuracy vs. human expert validation.

Economic metrics: Partner-reported $ in benefits accessed through newly encoded programs, estimated wage preservation from workforce-enabling programs (childcare, TANF).

Publication: Open evaluation report documenting encoding speed improvements, partner adoption, estimated downstream economic impact, challenges encountered, and replication guide for other civic tech infrastructure providers.

**Change to Existing Program:**

PolicyEngine currently serves 100,000+ users through partner tools, but coverage is limited by manual encoding speed. This project transforms HOW FAST we expand coverage: 20-30 programs in 6 months instead of 5-10. That 5× improvement means partners can serve 5× more benefit types.

Real example: Student Basic Needs Coalition wants all 50 state SNAP variations for college students. Manual encoding: 3-4 years. With AI: 6-8 months. That's thousands of students accessing food assistance years earlier.

The efficiency improvement compounds: Faster encoding → Partners expand faster → More people access benefits → More data validates models → AI improves → Even faster encoding. This virtuous cycle transforms benefit navigation from artisanal (one navigator, one state, one program at a time) to industrial scale (systematic coverage of all programs, all states, all navigators simultaneously).

**Why Infrastructure Investment Wins:**

Funding PolicyEngine isn't funding ONE benefit navigator. It's funding the calculation layer powering EVERY navigator. MyFriendBen, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, Amplifi, Benefits Kitchen, Code for America, and organizations that don't exist yet—all benefit from faster PolicyEngine development. Infrastructure leverage means each improvement multiplies across the entire ecosystem, reaching hundreds of thousands today and millions tomorrow.
