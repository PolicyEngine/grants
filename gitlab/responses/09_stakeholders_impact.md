- [Geographic scope - national, specific states/cities]

**Calculation/Rationale**:
[Explain how you arrived at this number and why it's realistic:
- Existing user base to build from (if applicable)
- Partner channels for distribution
- Marketing and outreach plans
- Conservative vs. stretch goals]

### Scale Pathway

**Beyond Grant Period**:
- [Targets for Year 1]
- [Targets for Year 2-3]
- [Vision for national/global scale]

## Specific Impact on Stakeholders

**Question**: Specific impact on stakeholders

---

### Expected Outcomes

**Economic Impact**:
1. **[Outcome 1]**: [e.g., Increased household income]
   - **Measure**: [e.g., Average dollars in additional benefits accessed]
   - **Target**: [e.g., $2,000 per household annually]
   - **Evidence basis**: [Why you expect this impact]

2. **[Outcome 2]**: [e.g., Improved financial stability]
   - **Measure**: [e.g., Reduction in financial stress indicators]
   - **Target**: [Specific quantitative target]
   - **Evidence basis**: [Supporting research or pilot data]

3. **[Outcome 3]**: [e.g., Enhanced employment outcomes]
   - **Measure**: [e.g., Training completion, job placement rate]
   - **Target**: [Specific target]
   - **Evidence basis**: [Why you expect this impact]

**Access and Equity Impact**:
- [How traditionally underserved populations will benefit]
- [Reduction in barriers to opportunity]
- [Improved awareness and understanding]

**Systems Change Impact**:
- [How this changes service delivery]
- [How this influences policy decisions]
- [Replication and scaling potential]

### Measurement Approach

**Data Collection**:
- [How you'll track usage and outcomes]
- [Surveys, interviews, administrative data, etc.]
- [Baseline and follow-up measurement]

**Evaluation**:
- [How you'll attribute outcomes to the intervention]
- [Comparison groups or counterfactual]
- [Third-party evaluation if applicable]

## Changes to Existing Program

**Question**: Changes to existing program (if applicable)

---

[If building on an existing PolicyEngine program or tool:]

**Current State**:
- [What exists today]
- [Current reach and impact]
- [Limitations or gaps]

**Planned Changes**:
- [What will be different with AI integration]
- [New capabilities enabled]
- [How this expands reach or impact]

**Why This Represents Transformation**:
- [What's fundamentally different, not just incremental]
- [What becomes possible that wasn't before]
- [How this changes the user experience or outcomes]

---

[If this is a new initiative:]

**Why Now**:
- [What gap or opportunity this addresses]
- [Why existing approaches fall short]
- [Why AI makes this possible now]

---

**Notes**:
- Be specific and quantitative where possible
- Show understanding of your target population
- Demonstrate realistic reach goals with clear rationale
- Connect outputs (people reached) to outcomes (lives improved)
- Show both individual impact and systems-level change
- Include equity lens - who benefits and why
