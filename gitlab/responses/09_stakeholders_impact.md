**Who**: Low-income families accessing benefits through navigation tools. Demographics: women (primary caregivers), communities of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, working families facing benefit cliffs. Intermediaries: MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition serving these populations.

**How Many**: Six-month pilot serves existing users across partners (MyFriendBen: 50K+, plus Amplifi/Starlight/SBNC users). AI acceleration enables systematic nationwide expansion of state programs beyond current piecemeal coverage, expanding partner reach. Long-term: open-source improvements available to any benefit navigation tool.

**What Impact**:
Direct improvements:
- 3-5× faster encoding (40-80→10-20 hours/program)
- Systematic nationwide coverage of state programs (vs. current state-by-state approach)
- Improved API performance
- Better form design reducing data requirements

Downstream potential depends on multiple factors (user awareness, application complexity, partner capacity). Conservative estimate: 10,000 users accessing $1,000 average benefits = $10M accessed. Childcare subsidies enable employment retention with substantial wage preservation effects.

We'll track: API calls for new programs, partner engagement metrics, programs encoded/month, time reduction, accuracy scores. Partners provide user metrics where available.

**Why Infrastructure**: When PolicyEngine adds programs, every partner immediately offers them without duplicating development. Infrastructure investment multiplies across organizations.

**Change**: Currently adding 100+ program improvements and features per 6 months manually. AI enables systematic nationwide expansion of complex state programs (TANF, CCDF, LIHEAP, SSI supplements) that currently only exist in select states. AI augments human expertise—experts still validate rules and ensure accuracy.
