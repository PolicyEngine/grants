PolicyEngine is infrastructureâ€”we measure impact through what partners achieve with improved capabilities.

Technical improvements we'll deliver: AI-accelerated encoding (targeting 20-30 programs vs. 5-10 baseline), reduced encoding time per program (from 40-80 hours to 10-15 hours), stochastic imputation enabling benefit estimates with less user data.

Partner adoption: When we add programs or capabilities, partners integrate them. MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, and Student Basic Needs Coalition will measure user engagement with AI-enabled features, completion rates with stochastic imputation, and benefits accessed through newly encoded programs.

We'll track and report: encoding speed improvements, programs added, partner integration speed, partner-reported user metrics. Since we're infrastructure, the economic impact depends on how partners deploy improvements to end users.
