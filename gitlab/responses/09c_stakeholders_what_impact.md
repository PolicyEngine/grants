PolicyEngine is infrastructure. We measure direct technical improvements; partners measure downstream user impact.

Technical outcomes we'll deliver:
- Atlas preventing link rot for 5-10 programs across 50 states
- 5-10 programs encoded nationwide using AI (LIHEAP, WIC, Section 8, rental assistance)
- Encoding time reduced (targeting 50%+ improvement)
- Published quality metrics: AI code vs. human golden PR baseline
- Published research: LLM benefit estimation accuracy with vs. without structured tools

Partners measure user impact:
- MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, Mirza will track: user engagement with newly encoded programs, completion rates, benefits accessed
- We'll collect and publish aggregated partner metrics

Research demonstrates: Structured tools (PolicyEngine API) vs. unstructured AI (ChatGPT alone). When people access benefits correctly vs. getting wrong information from hallucinating LLMs. Published evaluation establishes which LLMs work for benefits, where they fail, why structure matters.

Open source multiplier: Any improvements freely available to unlimited future users through Python package and Docker. We can't measure everyone who benefitsâ€”that's the nature of public infrastructure.
