All technical expertise resides within PolicyEngine's core team.

Pavel Makarchuk (Economist) and Ben Ogorek (PhD Statistics, NC State) lead research and evaluation. Pavel built enhanced microdata using ML serving 100K+ users. Ben developed calibration systems. Together they'll design LLM benefit estimation research.

Nikhil Woodruff (CTO) architected PolicyEngine's API infrastructure. He'll lead AI code generation, Atlas integration, and system architecture.

Max Ghenis (CEO, ex-Google data scientist) brings microsimulation expertise and AI integration experience. Led rapid model adoption and multi-agent workflows. Will lead rule extraction, Atlas development, and research publication.

Our team brings deep domain expertise from three years encoding 2,000+ benefit/tax variables. This hands-on experience with policy language, edge cases, and ambiguities proves crucial for training AI and distinguishing helpful from misleading outputs.

Already deployed: LLM policy analysis, multi-agent workflows, Atlas prototype. Currently using AI agents for TANF encodingâ€”this project systematizes with rigorous benchmarking.

OpenAI advisors help optimize prompts, prevent hallucinations, design evaluation methodology, ensure diverse test coverage.

Partner validation from MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, SBNC provides real-world testing and feedback.

Infrastructure operational: GCP, APIs, CI/CD, repositories. Adding AI to proven systems.

Capacity: 3.5 FTE sufficient for 6-month delivery without hiring.

Track record: Built PolicyEngine to 100K users in 3 years. Proven ability building complex systems while maintaining production quality.
