Six months: 100,000+ current users across API partners plus unknown number using free Python package and Docker image (not tracked—open source, no usage reporting).

Year 2: As AI-accelerated coverage expands (LIHEAP nationwide, WIC variations, Section 8, etc.), partners estimate 250,000-500,000 users.

Long-term: PolicyEngine is public infrastructure. Any organization can use it freely (open source) or affordably (2¢/request hosted API). As coverage improves, potential reach includes every benefit navigator, government calculator, and civic tech tool in the U.S.—millions of people served through tools we'll never know about. Open source multiplies impact beyond measurable partners.
