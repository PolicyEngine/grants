Six-month pilot: Infrastructure serving 100,000+ existing users across PolicyEngine API partners (MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition).

Year 2: Expanded coverage enables partners to reach 250,000-500,000 users as faster encoding unlocks previously inaccessible programs.

Long-term potential: PolicyEngine API is open-source infrastructure. Anyone building benefit navigation tools can use it. As coverage expands through AI acceleration, potential reach is millions.
