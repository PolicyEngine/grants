# How AI/ML/LLMs Will Be Used

**Question**: How AI/ML/LLMs will be used to advance project goals

---

## AI Technologies and Applications

### Primary AI Use Cases

1. **[Use Case 1]**
   - **Technology**: [e.g., GPT-4 for natural language understanding]
   - **Application**: [e.g., translating policy questions into simulations]
   - **Impact**: [e.g., makes policy analysis accessible to anyone]

2. **[Use Case 2]**
   - **Technology**: [e.g., ML for personalization]
   - **Application**: [e.g., tailoring recommendations to household circumstances]
   - **Impact**: [e.g., increases relevance and actionability]

3. **[Use Case 3]**
   - **Technology**: [e.g., Embedding models for semantic search]
   - **Application**: [e.g., finding relevant programs and benefits]
   - **Impact**: [e.g., connects people to opportunities they're eligible for]

### OpenAI Tools and APIs

Specific OpenAI capabilities we will leverage:
- [List specific APIs, models, or tools]
- [Explain how technical support from OpenAI engineers will be used]
- [Note how API credits will enable scale]

### What Makes This Transformative

[Explain why AI enables something fundamentally different, not just faster/cheaper:
- What was impossible before AI?
- How does this change the user experience?
- What systemic barrier does this remove?
- How does this create new pathways to economic opportunity?]

**Notes**:
- Be specific about technologies, not vague about "using AI"
- Show understanding of AI capabilities and limitations
- Connect each AI use directly to economic mobility outcomes
- Demonstrate this is strategic AI use, not AI for AI's sake
