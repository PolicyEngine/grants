# Concept Note Responses

This directory contains individual response files for each question in the concept note application.

## File Naming Convention

Name files based on the question they answer:
- `01_project_summary.md`
- `02_problem_statement.md`
- `03_ai_solution.md`
- `04_impact.md`
- etc.

## Response Guidelines

Each response file should:

1. **Include the question** at the top as a comment or heading
2. **State the word limit** (if applicable)
3. **Provide the response** in clear, concise language
4. **Track word count** to stay within limits
5. **Use markdown formatting** for readability

## Example Format

```markdown
# Question 1: Project Summary

**Word Limit**: 250 words
