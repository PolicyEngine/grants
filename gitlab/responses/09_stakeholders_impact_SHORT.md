**Who**: Low-income families accessing benefits through navigation tools. Demographics: women (primary caregivers), communities of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, working families facing benefit cliffs. Intermediaries: MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition serving these populations.

**How Many**: Six-month pilot serves existing users across partners (MyFriendBen: 50K+, plus Amplifi/Starlight/SBNC users). AI acceleration enables 15-20 new programs vs. 5-10 baseline, expanding partner reach. Long-term: open-source improvements available to any benefit navigation tool.

**What Impact**:
Direct improvements:
- 3-5× faster encoding (40-80→10-20 hours/program)
- 15-20 new programs in 6 months
- Improved API performance
- Better form design reducing data requirements

Downstream potential depends on multiple factors (user awareness, application complexity, partner capacity). Conservative estimate: 10,000 users accessing $1,000 average benefits = $10M accessed. Childcare subsidies enable employment retention with substantial wage preservation effects.

We'll track: API calls for new programs, partner engagement metrics, programs encoded/month, time reduction, accuracy scores. Partners provide user metrics where available.

**Why Infrastructure**: When PolicyEngine adds programs, every partner immediately offers them without duplicating development. Infrastructure investment multiplies across organizations.

**Change**: Currently 5-10 programs/year manually. AI enables 15-20+, focusing on complex state programs (TANF, CCDF, LIHEAP, SSI supplements). AI augments human expertise—experts still validate rules and ensure accuracy.
