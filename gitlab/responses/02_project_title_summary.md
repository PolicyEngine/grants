**Project Title:**
AI-Powered Rules-as-Code Infrastructure: Automating Benefit Policy from Documents to Calculations

**Project Summary (150 words):**

Benefit navigation tools like MyFriendBen and Starlight help millions access government assistance—but they're constrained by rules-as-code coverage. Manual encoding of benefit programs from policy documents is slow, expensive, and incomplete.

PolicyEngine will build a complete AI pipeline transforming benefit policy from source documents to accurate calculations. LLMs extract rules from legislative PDFs. AI generates PolicyEngine code and validates against authoritative sources. Machine learning models handle missing household data through stochastic imputation, predicting benefit ranges when information is incomplete. LLMs explain calculations in plain language.

This infrastructure enables benefit navigators to expand coverage 5-10× faster. With 100,000 current users across our API partners, AI-accelerated encoding unlocks billions in previously inaccessible benefits. Conservative estimate: 20 new programs × 5,000 users × $1,500 average benefit = $112M accessed, yielding 450× ROI. We're infrastructure—this makes it dramatically faster and more comprehensive.
