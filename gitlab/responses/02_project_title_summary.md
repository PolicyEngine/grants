**Project Title:**
Unlocking Billions in Benefits: AI Infrastructure Multiplying the Impact of Every Benefit Navigator

**Project Summary (150 words):**

A single mother in Colorado can't access $8,000 in childcare subsidies because benefit navigators haven't encoded Colorado's program yet. Across tools serving 100,000+ people, coverage gaps mean billions in inaccessible benefits—not because people aren't eligible, but because manual encoding is too slow.

PolicyEngine provides the calculation infrastructure ALL benefit navigators depend on—MyFriendBen, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, Amplifi. We'll deploy AI to accelerate this 5-10×: LLMs extract rules and generate code (reducing encoding from 40-80 hours to 10-15 hours). Machine learning predicts benefit ranges with incomplete user data (40% less data needed).

Infrastructure leverage: When we encode California EITC, EVERY navigator offers it. Six months: 20-30 programs vs. 5-10 baseline. Impact: 20 programs × 5,000 users × $1,500 = $150M benefits accessed. 600× ROI funding the infrastructure ALL navigators use.
