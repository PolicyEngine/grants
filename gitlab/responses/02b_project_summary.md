PolicyEngine provides open-source benefit calculation infrastructure (free Python package, Docker image, 2¢ API) powering MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, Mirza, and future tools. We model major federal programs nationwide, but LIHEAP, WIC, Section 8, rental assistance, and Medicaid LTSS exist only in states where partners funded deep implementations. Expanding these nationwide requires constant manual encoding.

End-to-end AI: Atlas document infrastructure feeds LLMs extracting rules and generating PolicyEngine code. We'll benchmark AI code against human "golden PR" standards using test suites, iteratively improving until quality matches experts.

Additionally: rigorous research generating thousands of test cases (households × programs) measuring LLM benefit estimation accuracy with raw documents versus PolicyEngine API access. This demonstrates why structured tools matter over "just ask ChatGPT."

Deliverables: Atlas foundation, 5-10 programs encoded nationwide with AI pipelines and quality benchmarking, published research on LLM reliability for benefits. Open-source tools available to anyone building benefit navigation.
