PolicyEngine provides open-source benefit calculation infrastructure (free Python package, Docker, 2¢ API) powering MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, Mirza. We model major federal programs nationwide, but LIHEAP, WIC, Section 8, and state rental assistance exist only in select states where partners funded implementations.

We'll build end-to-end AI: Atlas document infrastructure (Nava has expressed interest for their AI tools) feeds LLMs extracting rules and generating PolicyEngine code. We'll benchmark AI code against human "golden PR" standards, iteratively improving until quality matches experts—potentially hours instead of weeks for partner requests.

Additionally: rigorous research measuring LLM benefit estimation accuracy with raw documents versus PolicyEngine API access. Demonstrates why structured tools matter.

Deliverables: Atlas foundation, 5-10 programs encoded nationwide with quality benchmarking, published LLM evaluation research. Open-source for anyone building benefit tools.
