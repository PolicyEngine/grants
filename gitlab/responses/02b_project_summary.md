PolicyEngine already powers benefit navigation tools with nationwide coverage for SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, ACA subsidies, WIC, and federal and state tax credits. However, encoding state-specific program variations remains painfully manual. While we've implemented TANF, childcare subsidies, LIHEAP, and SSI supplements in select states, achieving nationwide coverage for these complex programs requires hundreds of developer hours per program.

This project builds an AI pipeline that transforms how we encode state-specific benefit rules. Starting with automated document retrieval and archiving, our system uses LLMs to extract rules and generate PolicyEngine code. We'll establish rigorous benchmarks by having experts create gold-standard implementations, then measure whether AI matches that quality through comprehensive test suites.

Additionally, we'll conduct research generating thousands of test cases to quantify LLM accuracy in benefit estimation, evaluating when structured tools versus language models are most effective. All infrastructure improvements will be open-source, multiplying impact across every organization building benefit tools.
