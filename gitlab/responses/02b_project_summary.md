Encoding benefit rules from policy documents is slow, manual work. PolicyEngine provides open-source calculation infrastructure (free Python package, Docker, 2¢ API) used by MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, Mirza. We model major federal programs nationwide, but LIHEAP, WIC, Section 8, and rental assistance exist only where partners funded implementations.

We'll build an AI pipeline: document retrieval and archiving feeds LLMs extracting rules and generating PolicyEngine code. The innovation is rigorous benchmarking—human experts encode programs as gold standards, then we measure whether AI matches that quality using test suites and iterative improvement. Goal: reduce encoding from weeks to hours.

Research component: generate thousands of test cases measuring LLM benefit estimation accuracy with policy documents versus PolicyEngine API. Quantifies why structured tools matter.

Deliverables: Document infrastructure, 5-10 programs encoded nationwide with quality benchmarking, published LLM accuracy research. Open-source for any organization building benefit tools.
