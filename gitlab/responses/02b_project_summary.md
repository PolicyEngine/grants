Benefit calculation infrastructure is the bottleneck limiting navigation tools. PolicyEngine and BenefitsKitchen power MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition—but keeping rules current as policies change and adding fine-grained eligibility details requires constant manual work. When Wisconsin updates childcare limits or California adjusts EITC, someone must read policy documents and hand-code updates. It's slow and expensive.

AI can automate this: LLMs extract rule changes and generate code. Machine learning predicts benefit ranges with incomplete user data. Natural language explanations make calculations comprehensible. This transforms rules-as-code from artisanal to automated.

Ecosystem leverage: PolicyEngine's API serves 100,000+ users across navigators. AI means faster updates, better accuracy, fuller coverage. Partners can serve programs currently too complex to maintain manually. Conservative: $150M in benefits accessed through expanded coverage. 600× ROI funding shared infrastructure.
