Encoding benefit rules from policy documents remains one of the most time-intensive bottlenecks in expanding safety net access. PolicyEngine provides the open-source calculation infrastructure powering MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, and other benefit navigation tools. While we've successfully encoded programs like TANF, childcare subsidies, LIHEAP, and SSI state supplements in select states, achieving nationwide coverage requires hundreds of developer hours per program.

This project builds an AI pipeline that transforms how we encode benefit rules. Starting with automated document retrieval and archiving, our system uses LLMs to extract rules and generate PolicyEngine code. We'll establish rigorous benchmarks by having experts create gold-standard implementations, then measure whether AI matches that quality through comprehensive test suites.

Additionally, we'll conduct research generating thousands of test cases to quantify LLM accuracy in benefit estimation, demonstrating why structured tools outperform raw language models. All infrastructure improvements will be open-source, multiplying impact across every organization building benefit tools.
