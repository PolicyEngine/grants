# Ethics and Bias Concerns

**Question**: Ethics and bias concerns and mitigation strategies

---

## Identified Risks and Concerns

### 1. Algorithmic Bias

**Concern**: [Describe potential for AI to amplify existing biases]
- Example: LLM training data may underrepresent certain communities
- Example: Policy recommendations may favor certain demographics
- Example: Language/literacy barriers in AI interface

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- [Strategy 1: e.g., Test across diverse demographic groups]
- [Strategy 2: e.g., Use human-in-the-loop verification]
- [Strategy 3: e.g., Monitor outcomes by subgroup]
- [Strategy 4: e.g., Community feedback mechanisms]

### 2. Access and Digital Divide

**Concern**: [Risk of excluding those without technology access]
- Example: Requires internet access and digital literacy
- Example: May be less accessible to older adults or non-English speakers

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- [Strategy 1: e.g., Multiple access channels including human assistance]
- [Strategy 2: e.g., Mobile-first design for smartphone access]
- [Strategy 3: e.g., Partner with community organizations for in-person support]
- [Strategy 4: e.g., Multilingual support]

### 3. Data Privacy and Consent

**Concern**: [Risks around personal/sensitive data]
- Example: Users may share sensitive financial information
- Example: Risk of data breaches or unauthorized access
- Example: Unclear how data is used by AI models

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- [Strategy 1: e.g., Minimal data collection - only what's necessary]
- [Strategy 2: e.g., Clear consent process and privacy controls]
- [Strategy 3: e.g., Data encryption and security best practices]
- [Strategy 4: e.g., Transparent data use policies]

### 4. AI Reliability and Errors

**Concern**: [Risk of AI making mistakes with consequences]
- Example: Incorrect benefit eligibility information
- Example: Hallucinations or incorrect policy interpretations
- Example: Over-reliance on AI without human verification

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- [Strategy 1: e.g., Confidence scores and uncertainty communication]
- [Strategy 2: e.g., Human review for high-stakes decisions]
- [Strategy 3: e.g., Clear disclaimers about limitations]
- [Strategy 4: e.g., Feedback loops to identify and correct errors]

### 5. Economic Displacement

**Concern**: [If automating tasks, impact on workers]
- Example: Could this replace jobs in benefits counseling or social services?

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- [Strategy 1: e.g., Designed to augment, not replace, human counselors]
- [Strategy 2: e.g., Free up staff time for higher-touch work]
- [Strategy 3: e.g., Training and transition support if applicable]

## Ongoing Monitoring and Accountability

### Evaluation Metrics
- [How you'll measure bias and fairness]
- [Disaggregated impact metrics by demographic group]
- [User satisfaction and trust measures]

### Governance
- [Who reviews ethical concerns and makes decisions]
- [Process for users to report issues]
- [Regular ethical audits or reviews]

### Transparency
- [How you'll communicate about AI capabilities and limitations]
- [Open source code for public scrutiny]
- [Public reporting on outcomes and equity metrics]

## Ethical Principles

[State your core ethical commitments:]
- **User Agency**: [Users maintain control and decision-making authority]
- **Equity**: [Actively work to reduce disparities, not increase them]
- **Transparency**: [Clear about how AI works and what it can/can't do]
- **Privacy**: [Protect user data and give users control]
- **Accountability**: [Take responsibility for impacts and address harms]

---

**Notes**:
- Show you've thought deeply about potential harms
- Be specific about mitigation strategies, not just general statements
- Demonstrate commitment to equity and inclusion
- Show ongoing vigilance, not just upfront measures
- Be honest about tradeoffs and limitations
- Reference relevant frameworks (e.g., AI Ethics guidelines)
