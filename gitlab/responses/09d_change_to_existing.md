PolicyEngine currently serves 100,000+ users through partner tools. Manual encoding limits how fast we expand coverage. This project improves encoding efficiency: targeting 20-30 programs in 6 months instead of 5-10 baseline.

When partners need fine-grained eligibility details (categorical eligibility chains, asset test exceptions, state-specific phase-out calculations), manual encoding takes weeks. With AI assistance: days. This responsiveness means partners can serve edge cases they currently must tell users "we can't calculate that yet."

Faster encoding enables partners to respond to user needs more rapidly. The cycle: faster encoding → partners expand coverage → more users access benefits → more data validates our models → AI improves → encoding gets even faster.
