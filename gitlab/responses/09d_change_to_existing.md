PolicyEngine currently covers major federal programs (SNAP, Medicaid, federal tax credits) and state tax credits nationwide. We model TANF, CCDF (childcare), LIHEAP, and SSI state supplements in select states (CO, CA, IL, NC, MA, TX) where partners funded deep implementations.

This project systematizes expanding partial state coverage to nationwide: LIHEAP in 50 states (currently 6), WIC state variations, Section 8 rules by jurisdiction, state rental assistance programs, potentially Medicaid LTSS state variations.

Efficiency improvements measured through:
- Encoding time per program: targeting 50%+ reduction (manual baseline: 40-80 hours, AI-assisted target: 20-40 hours with validation)
- Programs encoded per 6 months: targeting 5-10 vs. typical 2-5 baseline
- Quality maintained: AI code must match human golden PR standards (test suite pass rates, edge case coverage, documentation quality)

Current: If partner needs LIHEAP in a new state, manual encoding takes weeks. With AI pipelines: days.

Current: Partners request features; we prioritize by capacity. With AI: respond faster to more requests.

Improvement compounds: Faster encoding → partners expand coverage → more users access benefits → more validation data → AI improves → even faster encoding. This could transform benefit navigation from state-by-state artisanal development to systematic nationwide coverage.
