AI-powered benefit calculation infrastructure presents significant ethical responsibilities we take seriously:

**1. Accuracy and Hallucination Prevention**

Risk: LLMs might generate plausible-but-incorrect benefit rules, potentially misleading vulnerable families about crucial support.

Mitigation:
- Deterministic validation: Every AI-generated rule validated against authoritative policy documents
- Human review required: Developers review all code before production deployment
- Test suite enforcement: AI code must pass comprehensive tests matching human-encoded baselines
- Source citations: All rules link to specific policy documents for verification
- Clear limitations: We provide calculation infrastructure, not final eligibility determinations

**2. Bias in AI Code Generation**

Risk: AI models trained on existing code could perpetuate historical biases in how programs are implemented, potentially disadvantaging certain populations.

Mitigation:
- Diverse training data: Use implementations from multiple states with varying demographics
- Output audits: Review AI-generated code for patterns that might disadvantage specific groups
- Test case diversity: Ensure test suites cover diverse demographic scenarios
- Partner feedback loops: Frontline organizations validate that implementations serve all communities fairly
- Open development: Enable community review and correction of potential biases

**3. Equitable Program Coverage**

Risk: AI might preferentially encode "easier" programs while neglecting complex programs serving vulnerable populations.

Mitigation:
- Explicit prioritization: Target programs serving lowest-income families (TANF, CCDF, LIHEAP)
- Partner guidance: Frontline organizations identify highest-need coverage gaps
- Geographic equity: Ensure rural and Southern states receive equal attention
- Complexity embrace: Specifically tackle state variations that manual encoding struggles with

**4. Accessibility and Comprehension**

Risk: AI explanations might be incomprehensible to users with limited literacy or English proficiency.

Mitigation:
- Readability standards: Target 6th-8th grade reading level for all explanations
- User testing: Validate explanations with actual benefit recipients through partners
- Multiple formats: Technical documentation for caseworkers, plain language for families
- Language consideration: Prioritize programs with multilingual documentation
- Human fallback: Partners can disable AI explanations when inappropriate

**5. Responsible Open Source**

Risk: Publishing our models could enable misuse or exploitation.

Mitigation:
- Strategic disclosure: Publish methodologies and evaluation frameworks, not necessarily all model weights
- Usage guidelines: Clear documentation about appropriate applications
- Partner accountability: Work with known organizations with established user protection
- Community oversight: Open development enables collective responsibility

**6. Downstream Impact Accountability**

Risk: As infrastructure, our errors multiply across all partner organizations.

Mitigation:
- Quality gates: AI must match human baseline before deployment
- Staged rollout: New AI-encoded programs marked beta until validated
- Rapid response: 48-hour commitment to address reported errors
- Clear boundaries: Transparent about what we validate (calculations) vs. what we don't (application success)
- Continuous monitoring: Track accuracy metrics across all programs

**7. Protecting Vulnerable Populations**

Risk: Incorrect calculations could cause families to lose benefits or miss opportunities.

Mitigation:
- Conservative estimates: When uncertain, err toward showing potential eligibility
- Warning systems: Flag edge cases requiring human review
- Audit trails: Maintain records of calculation logic for appeals
- Partner training: Ensure organizations understand system limitations

**Governance Structure:**

- Monthly ethics reviews of AI outputs and partner feedback
- Quarterly bias audits with published results
- Public issue tracking for community accountability
- Academic partnerships for independent evaluation
- Clear escalation paths for ethical concerns

**Core Principle:**

Benefit calculations affect whether families can afford food, housing, and healthcare. This responsibility demands transparency, humility, and continuous improvement. Our open-source approach ensures every calculation can be verified, every assumption questioned, and every bias corrected.

We're building infrastructure for the most vulnerable. That privilege requires we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards, acknowledge our limitations, and remain accountable to the communities we ultimately serve.
