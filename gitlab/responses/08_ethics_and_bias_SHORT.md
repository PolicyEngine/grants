**1. Accuracy/Hallucination Prevention**
Risk: LLMs generate incorrect benefit rules.
Mitigation: All AI rules validated against policy documents. Human review required before deployment. Comprehensive test suites. Source citations for verification. Clear that we provide calculations, not final determinations.

**2. AI Bias**
Risk: Models perpetuate biases disadvantaging marginalized communities.
Mitigation: Diverse training data from multiple states. Output audits for bias patterns. Test coverage across demographics. Partner validation. Open development for community review.

**3. Equitable Coverage**
Risk: AI encodes "easier" programs, neglecting vulnerable populations.
Mitigation: Prioritize programs serving lowest-income families (TANF, CCDF, LIHEAP). Partner guidance on coverage gaps. Geographic equity across rural/Southern states.

**4. Accessibility**
Risk: AI explanations incomprehensible to limited-literacy users.
Mitigation: 6th-8th grade reading level. User testing through partners. Multiple formats (technical/plain language). Multilingual documentation priority. Human fallback option.

**5. Open Source Responsibility**
Risk: Published models enable misuse.
Mitigation: Publish methodologies, not all model weights. Clear usage guidelines. Work with established organizations. Community oversight.

**6. Downstream Accountability**
Risk: Errors multiply across partners.
Mitigation: AI must match human baselines. Beta rollout for new programs. 48-hour error response. Clear boundaries on what we validate. Continuous accuracy monitoring.

**7. Protecting Vulnerable Populations**
Risk: Errors cause benefit loss.
Mitigation: Conservative eligibility estimates. Flag edge cases for review. Audit trails for appeals. Partner training on limitations.

**Governance**: Monthly AI output reviews, quarterly bias audits, public issue tracking, academic partnerships, clear escalation paths.

Core principle: Benefit calculations affect basic needs. Open-source ensures every calculation verifiable, every assumption questionable, every bias correctable.
