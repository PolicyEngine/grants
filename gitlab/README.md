# GitLab Foundation - AI for Economic Opportunity Fund

**Deadline**: October 31, 2025, 8:00 PM ET / 5:00 PM PT ‚è∞
**Amount**: $250,000
**Duration**: 6 months (March-September 2026)
**Application Form**: https://www.gitlabfoundation.org/futureofwork

## üéØ APPLICATION READY - Infrastructure That Multiplies Impact

### Strategy: AI-Powered Rules Infrastructure for Benefit Navigation Ecosystem

**Project Title:**
AI-Powered Rules-as-Code Infrastructure: Automating Benefit Policy from Documents to Calculations

**Core Concept:**
Complete AI pipeline transforming benefit policy documents into accurate calculations‚Äîenabling benefit navigation partners to expand coverage 3-5√ó faster while maintaining quality.

**Three Integrated AI Systems:**
1. **Atlas Document Infrastructure** - Archive and monitor policy documents (demo: https://policyengine.github.io/atlas/)
2. **AI Code Generation** - Extract rules and generate PolicyEngine code with rigorous benchmarking
3. **LLM Evaluation Research** - Quantify why structured tools outperform raw language models

### Why This Approach Works

**Clear Value Proposition:**
- We're infrastructure that enables consumer tools‚Äînot competing with them
- Partners (MyFriendBen, Starlight, Amplifi) explicitly need faster encoding
- Proven track record: manually encoded TANF, CCDF, LIHEAP, SSI supplements
- AI systematizes what we already do manually

**Honest Positioning:**
- ‚úÖ B2B infrastructure enabling B2C partners
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive AI solution addressing real bottleneck
- ‚úÖ Measurable through concrete metrics
- ‚úÖ Open source multiplies impact across ecosystem

### Impact Through Partners

**Infrastructure Improvements:**
- 3-5√ó faster encoding (40-80 hrs ‚Üí 10-20 hrs per program)
- 15-20 new programs in 6 months (vs. 5-10 baseline)
- Systematic nationwide coverage of TANF, CCDF, LIHEAP, SSI supplements

**Downstream Potential:**
- MyFriendBen (50K users) can expand to new states faster
- Starlight can offer benefit estimates with less user data
- Student Basic Needs Coalition gets campus-specific programs
- Any new organization can build on improved infrastructure

### All 9 Sections Complete:

1. ‚úÖ **Contact Information** - PSL Foundation details
2. ‚úÖ **Project Summary** - Clean, focused 150-word summary
3. ‚úÖ **Project Leadership** - Max, Nikhil, Pavel, Ben with expertise
4. ‚úÖ **AI Use** - Three integrated systems with Atlas demo
5. ‚úÖ **Scope of Work** - Clear 6-month milestones
6. ‚úÖ **Data Sources** - 4 accessible sources, no legal concerns
7. ‚úÖ **Technical Expertise** - In-house AI/ML team proven capability
8. ‚úÖ **Ethics & Bias** - 7 risks with specific mitigation strategies
9. ‚úÖ **Stakeholders & Impact** - Realistic projections, measured approach

## Key Technical Achievements to Emphasize:

- **Existing foundation**: Atlas demo, 1000+ PRs, production ML models
- **Proven feasibility**: Already using Claude Code for TANF encoding
- **Rigorous approach**: Golden PR benchmarks, published metrics
- **Research component**: First systematic evaluation of LLM benefit accuracy

## Probability Assessment: 35-40%

**Strengths:**
- Technical sophistication with existing foundation
- Clear partner demand and validation
- Open source approach aligns with GitLab values
- Research component adds intellectual rigor
- Team has proven AI/ML expertise

**Challenges:**
- Infrastructure vs. consumer tool preference
- Indirect impact measurement
- Complex technical story

## Strategic Value Beyond Award:

Even if not selected, this application:
- Documents comprehensive AI vision for PolicyEngine
- Shows GitLab/Ballmer/OpenAI our infrastructure role
- Positions for future opportunities
- Builds relationships with AI-focused funders

## Submission Checklist:

- [ ] Review improved responses in `/responses/` folder
- [ ] Copy each section to application form
- [ ] Double-check Atlas demo link works
- [ ] Verify all LinkedIn profiles accessible
- [ ] Submit before 8:00 PM ET deadline

## What Makes This Honest:

We're not pretending to be a consumer app. We're infrastructure that makes consumer apps better. The encoding bottleneck is real, our solution is technically sound, and the downstream impact‚Äîwhile indirect‚Äîis substantial and measurable through partner metrics.

This positions PolicyEngine as essential infrastructure in the benefit navigation ecosystem, showing how AI can transform not just individual tools but entire sectors through strategic infrastructure investment.
