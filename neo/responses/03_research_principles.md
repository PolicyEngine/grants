PolicyEngine recognizes that rigorous quantitative analysis tells only part of the story about how policies affect people's lives. We don't represent communities experiencing economic insecurity—we provide infrastructure FOR them. This understanding shapes how we address each research principle:

Intersectional approach reflecting lived experience:

Our microsimulation models calculate policy impacts across income, household composition, geography, age, employment status, gender, race, and ethnicity. However, numbers alone cannot capture intersectional experience. This is why partnerships with organizations serving people with lived experience are essential. MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help individuals identify benefits—tools used by people navigating complex systems, often in crisis. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity. Our journalism partnerships add qualitative understanding of what quantitative impacts mean for safety, dignity, and belonging. We provide numbers; partners contribute understanding of what those numbers mean.

Honoring distinct worldviews:

PolicyEngine operates as neutral infrastructure. We don't advocate for policies; we build tools communities across the political spectrum can use according to their values. Conservative think tanks analyzing work incentives, progressive groups examining poverty reduction, and nonpartisan journalists all use the same rigorous foundation but interpret findings through their distinct worldviews.

Demonstrated partnership with historically marginalized communities:

We don't claim to speak for communities experiencing economic insecurity. We invest in building infrastructure they can use. Geographic inequality in analysis capacity disproportionately affects regions with concentrations of historically marginalized populations. Our partnership strategy prioritizes organizations in the American South, smaller metros, and rural areas—places lacking sophisticated policy analysis infrastructure. Thanks to NEO's previous support, we successfully engaged organizations that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling. This grant would systematize that approach, building permanent capacity rather than extracting data.

Expansive understanding beyond financial outcomes:

PolicyEngine calculates financial impacts—poverty rates, income changes, benefit receipt. But economic mobility encompasses dignity, agency, belonging, and autonomy—dimensions microsimulation cannot quantify. Our journalism partnerships address this gap. When a local reporter uses our congressional district data showing 1,200 children lifted from poverty, then interviews families about what stable childcare means for their lives, the combination captures both financial and human dimensions.

Innovative uses of qualitative data:

This project systematizes partnerships pairing hyperlocal microsimulation with community storytelling. Thanks to Arnold Ventures, we've developed congressional district, state legislative district, and metro area-level capability. By partnering with local journalists, we create space for ethnographic reporting and community-designed research questions. A Birmingham journalist asks "how would this policy affect families in my city?" then uses our tools to identify households and tell their stories. The research question originates in the community; PolicyEngine provides infrastructure.

Our commitment:

We recognize PolicyEngine brings technical expertise but not lived experience of economic insecurity. Our role is building infrastructure communities can use according to their priorities. This grant enables systematic support—not just tools, but dedicated staff time for training, relationship-building, and sustained partnership with organizations rooted in communities we serve but don't represent. We commit to moving at the speed of trust.
