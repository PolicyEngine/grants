Quantitative analysis tells only part of the story. Our role is providing infrastructure that communities can use according to their priorities. This shapes how we address each research principle:

Intersectional approach reflecting lived experience:

Our microsimulation models calculate policy impacts across income, household composition, geography, age, employment, gender, race, and ethnicity. However, numbers alone cannot capture intersectional experience. This is why partnerships with organizations serving people with lived experience are essential. MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help individuals identify benefits—tools for people navigating complex systems, often in crisis. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity. Our journalism partnerships add qualitative understanding of what quantitative impacts mean for safety, dignity, and belonging. We provide numbers; partners contribute understanding of what those numbers mean.

Honoring distinct worldviews:

PolicyEngine provides neutral infrastructure that communities across the political spectrum use according to their own values and priorities. Conservative think tanks analyzing work incentives, progressive groups examining poverty reduction, and nonpartisan journalists all use the same rigorous foundation but interpret findings through their distinct worldviews. This pluralistic approach honors diverse ways of understanding policy impacts.

Demonstrated partnership with historically marginalized communities:

Our role is building infrastructure that communities can use according to their priorities. Geographic inequality in analysis capacity disproportionately affects regions with historically marginalized populations. This grant would enable partnerships focused on the American South, smaller metros, and rural areas—places currently lacking sophisticated policy analysis infrastructure. Thanks to NEO's previous support, we successfully engaged organizations that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling. This grant would systematize that approach with dedicated staff providing training, technical support, and tools that remain accessible to communities after the grant period ends.

Expansive understanding beyond financial outcomes:

PolicyEngine calculates financial impacts—poverty rates, income changes, benefit receipt. But economic mobility encompasses dignity, agency, belonging, and autonomy—dimensions microsimulation cannot quantify. Our journalism partnerships address this gap. When a local reporter uses our congressional district data showing 1,200 children lifted from poverty, then interviews families about what stable childcare means for their lives, the combination captures both financial and human dimensions.

Innovative uses of qualitative data:

This project systematizes partnerships pairing hyperlocal microsimulation with community storytelling. Arnold Ventures funded our congressional district and state-level capability. This grant would expand to state legislative districts and metro areas for analyzing federal and state policies at unprecedented local scales. By partnering with local journalists, we create space for ethnographic reporting. A Birmingham journalist asks "how would this policy affect families in my city?" then uses our tools to tell their stories. The research question originates in the community; PolicyEngine provides infrastructure.

Our commitment:

PolicyEngine's leadership has direct family experience navigating Section 8, Medicaid, and disability services. This understanding of how complex eligibility rules affect families informs our commitment to building accurate, accessible infrastructure. This grant enables systematic support—dedicated staff time for training, relationship-building, and sustained partnership with community-rooted organizations. We commit to moving at the speed of trust.
