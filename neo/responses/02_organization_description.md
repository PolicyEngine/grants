PolicyEngine develops free, open-source microsimulation models that calculate how tax and benefit policies affect individual households and entire populations. Our platform models federal and state programs including income taxes, the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and other programs across all 50 states.

What we do:

We provide computational infrastructure serving organizations helping people navigate benefit systems and researchers analyzing policy impacts. Our API powers benefit access tools used by individuals experiencing economic insecurity: MyFriendBen for benefit eligibility screening, Amplifi's Benefit Navigator for accurate benefit information, and Student Basic Needs Coalition's SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity.

On the policy side, our infrastructure serves users from congressional offices to community organizations. Staff at the Joint Economic Committee, congressional offices, New York State Senate, and DC Council use our tools—in some cases citing our research when proposing policies like state child tax credits. State-level organizations like Colorado Fiscal Institute and national policy organizations including Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our infrastructure, as do community organizations like Mother's Outreach Network.

NEO's impact on our sustainability:

Thanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we built the flexible partnership capacity that now sustains our work. That funding enabled us to engage organizations lacking microsimulation access—including partnerships with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center. These relationships directly resulted in Pritzker Children's Initiative supporting our child poverty analysis work. This demonstrates how flexible general operating support enables relationship-building essential for long-term sustainability.

Arnold Ventures funds our congressional district-level data capability. The National Science Foundation supports our open-source ecosystem. These provide technical infrastructure. This NEO grant would sustain the partnership capacity enabling organizations to use that infrastructure.

How our work leads to impact:

We make sophisticated analysis accessible to those previously lacking capacity—benefit navigation tools, local journalists, state policy organizations, community groups. This democratized access enables communities to participate in policy debates with evidence, leading to policies that more effectively address economic mobility.

How we define success:

Success means MyFriendBen can reliably help someone identify benefits, a small-town newspaper can analyze policy impacts, and a state legislator can understand constituent effects—all using the same rigorous foundation. We measure reach, sustainability of partner capacity, influence on decisions advancing economic mobility, and infrastructure quality.
