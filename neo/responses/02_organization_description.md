PolicyEngine develops and operates free, open-source microsimulation models that calculate how tax and benefit policies affect individual households and entire populations. Our platform enables users to model federal and state programs including income taxes, payroll taxes, the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and dozens of other programs across all 50 states.

What we do:

We provide computational infrastructure serving two interconnected communities: organizations helping people navigate benefit systems, and researchers analyzing policy impacts on economic mobility.

On the direct service side, our API powers benefit access tools used by individuals experiencing economic insecurity. MyFriendBen uses our calculations for benefit eligibility screening. Amplifi's Benefit Navigator depends on our models to provide accurate benefit information. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP eligibility calculations to support college students facing food insecurity. These organizations need reliable, real-time calculations—PolicyEngine provides that infrastructure.

On the policy side, our infrastructure serves users from congressional offices to state legislative staff to community organizations. Staff at the Joint Economic Committee, congressional offices, New York State Senate, and DC Council use our tools for policy analysis—in some cases citing our research when proposing policies like state child tax credits. State-level organizations like Colorado Fiscal Institute depend on our models for analysis. National policy organizations including Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our infrastructure, as do community organizations like Mother's Outreach Network in DC. Academic researchers at institutions including Georgetown and University of Michigan use our tools for economic mobility research. Users can calculate impacts on individual households, understand distributional effects across income groups, estimate budgetary costs, and analyze poverty and inequality changes—all at no cost and without specialized training.

NEO's impact on our sustainability:

Thanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we were able to build the flexible partnership capacity that now sustains our work. That funding enabled us to respond to policy analysis needs across the country and engage organizations that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling—including partnerships with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center.

These strengthened relationships within the early childhood policy network directly resulted in the Pritzker Children's Initiative supporting our child poverty analysis work specifically. This demonstrates how flexible general operating support enables the relationship-building essential for long-term sustainability. NEO's investment in responsive capacity created focused funding for child poverty work, while the broader partnership infrastructure that made it possible still needs support.

Thanks to Arnold Ventures, we now have congressional district-level data capability. Thanks to the National Science Foundation, we're expanding our open-source ecosystem. These investments provide technical infrastructure. This NEO grant would sustain the partnership capacity that enables organizations to actually use that infrastructure.

How our work leads to impact:

Our impact pathway connects infrastructure to use. First, we make sophisticated analysis accessible to those who previously lacked capacity—benefit navigation tools, local journalists, state policy organizations, community groups. Second, this democratized access enables more communities to participate in policy debates with evidence. Third, better-informed debates lead to policies that more effectively address economic mobility, because policymakers understand tradeoffs and communities can hold them accountable with data.

How we define success:

We measure success through four dimensions: (1) reach—the number and diversity of organizations using our infrastructure, (2) sustainability—whether organizations develop lasting ability to use our tools independently, (3) influence—instances where our analysis enables decisions that advance economic mobility, and (4) infrastructure quality—whether calculations are accurate, accessible, and continuously improved. Success means MyFriendBen can reliably help someone identify benefits, a small-town newspaper can analyze policy impacts, and a state legislator can understand constituent effects—all using the same rigorous foundation.
