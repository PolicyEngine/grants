# How would a grant from this fund enable you to test, scale, or refine bold or imaginative ideas aimed at advancing economic mobility and opportunity?

**The Bold Idea:**
PolicyEngine has developed breakthrough capability to analyze tax and benefit policy impacts at three unprecedented geographic scales: congressional districts (435), state legislative districts (~7,400), and metro areas (384). Thanks to Arnold Ventures support, this congressional district-level infrastructure now exists. Thanks to NEO's prior support, we have engaged organizations across the country that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling. But without dedicated staff to systematically support local partnerships, this technical capability and organizational relationships cannot reach their full potential. This grant would scale a proven model: pairing sophisticated microsimulation infrastructure with local journalism and community organizations to create participatory policy research combining quantitative rigor with qualitative storytelling.

**Building on Proven Foundation:**
NEO's previous general operating support delivered concrete results that demonstrate this model's viability. The flexible funding enabled us to build partnerships with organizations like Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center—relationships that directly resulted in securing support from the Pritzker Children's Initiative for sustained child poverty analysis work. This shows how investing in relationship-building and responsive analysis capacity creates long-term sustainability.

Our recent National Science Foundation award expands our capacity to develop open-source ecosystems—enabling any organization to build on PolicyEngine's infrastructure. Arnold Ventures' investment in hyperlocal data created the technical foundation. This grant would add the missing piece: dedicated staff to transform technical capability and successful but ad hoc partnerships into systematic, sustainable infrastructure.

**Why This Is Imaginative:**
Most policy research follows an extractive model: national organizations analyze policies, publish reports, and move to the next project. Communities receive analysis but not analytical capacity. Our model inverts this. We provide permanent infrastructure—open-source tools, hyperlocal data, training—and communities decide what to analyze, how to interpret findings, and which stories to tell. A journalist in rural Georgia can model state tax credit proposals for her legislative district. A think tank in Boise can analyze federal policy impacts on Idaho metros. A community organization in any city can understand how benefit changes affect their service area. The research questions originate in communities, not Washington DC.

**Testing a New Research-Journalism Partnership Model:**
Most research organizations treat journalism as an afterthought—"let's get media coverage of our report." We propose the opposite: journalists as primary research partners who combine PolicyEngine's quantitative infrastructure with ethnographic reporting. This works through three mechanisms:

1. **Embeddable Calculators:** We build tools that local news outlets can embed directly in articles, enabling readers to calculate how policies affect their own household. A story about child tax credit expansion includes a calculator where readers input their income, family size, and state—then see their personal impact. This transforms passive news consumption into active policy exploration.

2. **Newsroom Training:** We teach journalists to use PolicyEngine tools directly—no need to wait for researchers to run analysis. A reporter covering state legislature can model proposed tax changes herself, calculate district-level impacts, then identify and interview affected constituents. Analysis becomes part of reporting workflow, not external expertise.

3. **Data Journalism Infrastructure:** We provide district-level datasets that journalists can use for data-driven stories. When federal policy debates emerge, local outlets can immediately report on local impacts rather than relying on generic national coverage.

**What We Would Test:**
Over one year, we would pilot this model with three partner types across 15-20 organizations:

**Local News Outlets (5-6 partnerships, $30k total):**
- Small metro newspapers, public radio stations, nonprofit investigative outlets
- Geographic priority: Southern states, smaller metros, rural areas
- Test: Can embedding PolicyEngine tools in newsrooms improve local policy coverage? Do embeddable calculators increase reader engagement? Does hyperlocal data enable stories that wouldn't otherwise exist?

**Regional Policy Organizations (8-10 partnerships, $40k total):**
- State-level think tanks, policy coalitions, research groups across political spectrum
- Test: Does state legislative district data change how organizations approach state policy advocacy? Can smaller organizations with training use sophisticated microsimulation independently?

**Community Organizations (5-6 partnerships, $30k total):**
- Direct service providers, community development corporations
- Test: Can organizations serving economically insecure families use policy analysis tools to inform their work? Does understanding benefit interactions and cliff effects improve service delivery?

**The Innovation in Practice:**
Imagine a state considering a new child tax credit. Traditional analysis: national think tank publishes report showing statewide poverty impact, maybe breaks down by income quintile.

Our model: State policy coalition uses PolicyEngine to calculate impacts by legislative district, identifying which districts see largest benefits. Local newspaper in district with high child poverty embeds calculator in article, enabling readers to see their household impact. Reporter interviews three families across income distribution about what the credit would mean—not just financially, but for childcare stability, ability to work, sense of economic security. Community organization serving families models how the credit interacts with SNAP and childcare subsidies their clients receive, identifying which families face benefit cliffs.

Result: quantitative analysis (district-level data) combines with qualitative insights (journalism, lived experience) to paint complete picture. Analysis capacity builds in the community, not extracted by distant researchers.

**Why This Advances Economic Mobility:**
This model addresses a fundamental barrier to economic mobility: information asymmetry. When only well-resourced national organizations can analyze policy impacts, communities lack tools to advocate for their interests or hold policymakers accountable. By democratizing access to sophisticated analysis, we enable communities to participate in policy debates with evidence. Local journalists can ask "how does this affect my readers?" Local legislators can understand constituent impacts. Community organizations can identify policies that help families they serve.

**Sustainability Proven Through NEO's Prior Support:**
NEO's previous investment demonstrates this approach's sustainability potential. The general operating support enabled relationship-building that resulted in new funding streams—showing that investing in responsive capacity and partnerships creates lasting organizational sustainability, not just short-term project support. This grant would systematize that successful model, creating replicable infrastructure for sustained local engagement.

**Budget ($200,000):**
- **Personnel ($110k):** 1 FTE Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator for training, technical support, relationship management
- **Partnership Grants ($70k):** Mini-grants enabling partners to dedicate staff time to learning and using tools
- **Training & Infrastructure ($20k):** Regional workshops, embeddable calculator development, documentation, travel

**What We'll Learn:**
This pilot will answer critical questions: Does hyperlocal data change local policy advocacy effectiveness? Can research-journalism partnerships produce analysis that captures both quantitative rigor and qualitative depth? What support do different organization types need to use sophisticated tools independently? Can this model strengthen local journalism and analysis infrastructure in underserved regions?

Most importantly: does democratizing access to rigorous policy analysis strengthen civic participation and enable more communities to advocate for policies that advance economic mobility in their regions?

This is bold because it reimagines the relationship between research institutions and communities—from experts providing answers to infrastructure providers enabling communities to find their own.
