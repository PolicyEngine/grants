**What we're asking to sustain:**

PolicyEngine has developed infrastructure that organizations serving people with lived experience depend on. MyFriendBen uses our API for benefit eligibility screening. Amplifi's Benefit Navigator relies on our calculations to provide accurate benefit information. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP eligibility calculations to support college students facing food insecurity. Thanks to Arnold Ventures' support, we now have congressional district, state legislative district, and metro area-level analysis capability—enabling unprecedented geographic granularity.

This infrastructure exists. What's missing is sustained capacity to support the organizations that use it.

Thanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we were able to respond to partnership needs as they emerged—working with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, which led to Pritzker Children's Initiative funding for child poverty work specifically. We experimented with journalism partnerships, trained organizations without traditional modeling resources, and built relationships that created sustainable funding.

This grant would systematize and sustain that successful model. Instead of ad-hoc partnerships enabled by flexible funding, we would build permanent capacity to support organizations that depend on PolicyEngine's infrastructure.

**The capacity we need to build:**

Without dedicated staff, even excellent infrastructure goes underutilized. Organizations need training, technical assistance, and relationship management to effectively use sophisticated tools. This is especially true for local journalism, community organizations, and smaller policy groups that lack dedicated data staff.

This grant would fund **one full-time Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator** to provide systematic support across three partnership types:

**Local journalism partnerships (6 outlets, $36k in mini-grants):**
Our primary focus. Local news outlets serve communities but lack sophisticated policy analysis capacity. We've tested journalism partnerships informally; this grant would systematize the model. The coordinator would:
- Train journalists to use PolicyEngine tools directly for reporting
- Develop embeddable calculators that news outlets can integrate into articles, enabling readers to see how policies affect their own household
- Provide technical assistance when outlets cover policy debates
- Build templates and documentation enabling any outlet to replicate the model

Geographic priority: Southern states, smaller metros, rural areas where local journalism is resource-constrained but serves communities NEO prioritizes.

**Regional policy organizations (4-5 partners, $18k in mini-grants):**
State-level think tanks, policy coalitions, and research groups across the political spectrum that want to use state legislative district data for analysis but need training and support. These are organizations serving communities that currently lack sophisticated modeling capacity.

**Community organizations (2-3 partners, $6k in mini-grants):**
Direct service providers and community organizations serving people experiencing economic insecurity. These groups understand benefit cliff effects and program interactions from daily work with clients, but lack tools to model policy alternatives. The coordinator would provide training and technical assistance enabling them to use PolicyEngine's infrastructure for their communities.

Total: 12-15 sustained partnerships (not 20 shallow ones). The emphasis is depth and sustainability, not breadth.

**Why this builds sustainable capacity:**

This model creates three forms of sustainability:

1. **Organizational sustainability for PolicyEngine:** Rather than depending on one-off flexible funding to respond to requests, we build permanent staff capacity for partnership support. The coordinator role becomes an established function, not a temporary project.

2. **Partner sustainability:** Organizations learn to use PolicyEngine's infrastructure independently. Training and technical assistance create lasting capability. When the grant ends, partners retain skills and tools remain freely accessible. We're not creating dependency; we're building capacity.

3. **Field sustainability:** Open-source documentation and replicable models enable any organization to adopt the approach. When we develop embeddable calculators for six news outlets, any outlet can use them. When we create training materials, any organization can access them. The infrastructure benefits the entire field.

**How this advances economic mobility:**

Geographic inequality in analysis capacity creates information asymmetry. When only well-resourced national organizations can analyze policy impacts, communities lack tools to advocate for their interests or hold policymakers accountable. By systematically supporting local organizations to use sophisticated infrastructure, we enable evidence-based participation in policy debates at the community level.

Local journalists can report on how policies affect their readers specifically. State policy organizations can analyze district-level impacts. Community organizations serving people experiencing economic insecurity can identify which policy changes help their clients. This democratized access to analysis infrastructure advances economic mobility by enabling communities to advocate effectively for policies that work.

**Budget ($200,000):**

- **Personnel ($110,000):** 1 FTE Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator
  - Training delivery and curriculum development
  - Ongoing technical assistance and relationship management
  - Documentation and replication materials
  - Partnership recruitment and coordination

- **Partnership Mini-Grants ($60,000):**
  - 6 journalism partnerships × $6,000 = $36,000
  - 4-5 policy organizations × $4,000 = $18,000
  - 2-3 community organizations × $3,000 = $6,000
  - Mini-grants enable partners to dedicate staff time to learning and using tools

- **Infrastructure & Training ($30,000):**
  - Embeddable calculator development and customization
  - Regional workshops and training events
  - Travel to partner communities
  - Documentation, case studies, and replication guides
  - Evaluation and learning

**What success looks like:**

After one year:
- 6 local news outlets regularly using PolicyEngine tools in policy coverage, with embeddable calculators deployed
- 4-5 regional policy organizations conducting independent analysis using state legislative district data
- 2-3 community organizations using PolicyEngine infrastructure to inform their work with clients
- Open-source documentation enabling any organization to replicate the model
- Case studies demonstrating impact on local policy debates
- Proven coordinator role that can be sustained through diverse funding

This isn't a pilot testing whether something works. It's systematizing and sustaining something that NEO's prior flexible support proved works. We're asking for continued support to build the capacity that makes our infrastructure accessible to the organizations serving communities NEO prioritizes.
