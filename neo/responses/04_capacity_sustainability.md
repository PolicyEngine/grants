What we're asking to sustain:

PolicyEngine provides infrastructure that organizations serving people with lived experience depend on: MyFriendBen for benefit eligibility, Amplifi's Benefit Navigator for accurate calculations, Student Basic Needs Coalition for SNAP eligibility. Arnold Ventures funded our congressional district and state-level analysis capability. This grant would expand geographic granularity to state legislative districts and metro areas while building sustained capacity to support organizations using this infrastructure.

Thanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we responded to partnership needs as they emerged—working with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, leading to Pritzker Children's Initiative funding for child poverty work. We experimented with journalism partnerships and trained organizations without traditional modeling resources. This grant would systematize that successful model, building permanent capacity instead of ad-hoc partnerships.

The capacity we need to build:

Without dedicated staff, infrastructure goes underutilized. Organizations need training, technical assistance, and relationship management to use sophisticated tools. This grant would fund one full-time Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator providing systematic support to 12-15 organizations:

Local journalism partnerships (6 outlets, $36k): Our primary focus. The coordinator trains journalists to use PolicyEngine tools directly, develops embeddable calculators enabling readers to see personal policy impacts, and provides technical assistance. Geographic priority: Southern states, smaller metros, rural areas where journalism is resource-constrained.

Regional policy organizations (4-5 partners, $18k): State-level think tanks and policy coalitions across the political spectrum needing training to use state legislative district data.

Community organizations (2-3 partners, $6k): Direct service providers understanding benefit cliffs from daily work but lacking tools to model alternatives.

Why this builds sustainable capacity:

This creates three forms of sustainability: (1) Organizational—permanent staff capacity for partnership support, not temporary projects. (2) Partner—organizations learn to use infrastructure independently; skills persist after the grant ends. (3) Field—open-source documentation enables any organization to adopt the approach.

Geographic inequality in analysis capacity creates information asymmetry. When only well-resourced national organizations can analyze policy impacts, communities lack tools to advocate effectively. By systematically supporting local organizations, we enable evidence-based participation in policy debates. Local journalists report on reader impacts. State policy organizations analyze district-level effects. Community organizations identify which policies help their clients.

Budget ($200,000): Personnel ($110,000): coordinator for training, technical assistance, relationship management. Partnership mini-grants ($60,000): 6 journalism × $6,000, 4-5 policy orgs × $4,000, 2-3 community orgs × $3,000. Infrastructure ($30,000): embeddable calculators, workshops, travel, documentation.

After one year: 6 news outlets using PolicyEngine tools with embeddable calculators deployed, 4-5 policy organizations conducting independent analysis, 2-3 community organizations using infrastructure to inform client work, open-source documentation enabling replication, proven coordinator role sustainable through diverse funding. This systematizes what NEO's prior support proved works.
