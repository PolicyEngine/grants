PolicyEngine's mission is to compute the impact of public policy for the world. We build free, open-source microsimulation models that enable anyone—policymakers, researchers, journalists, advocates, and the public—to rigorously analyze how tax and benefit policies affect households and society.

We work toward a future where evidence-based policy analysis is not a privilege of well-resourced national organizations, but public infrastructure accessible to every community. Today, sophisticated microsimulation capacity concentrates in Washington DC, New York, and San Francisco. Smaller metros, rural areas, and regions outside major coastal cities lack the infrastructure to independently analyze how policies affect their communities. This creates geographic inequality in policy knowledge—some places can participate in informed debates about economic mobility policies while others cannot.

Our vision is a world where a state legislator in Alabama can model how a state tax credit affects her district, where a journalist in rural Montana can analyze federal benefit changes for her readers, where a community organization in any city can understand policy impacts on the families they serve, and where benefit navigation tools can provide accurate, real-time information to people seeking support.

PolicyEngine provides infrastructure used by over 100,000 people annually—both policy analysts and individuals experiencing economic insecurity. Organizations serving people with lived experience depend on our calculations: MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help people identify benefits they qualify for; Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our models to support college students facing food and housing insecurity. Simultaneously, policy organizations like Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our tools for analysis. Our work is strictly nonpartisan—we provide neutral infrastructure that any individual or organization can use to analyze any tax or benefit proposal according to their own values and priorities.
