## Overview

PolicyEngine represents a transformative cyberinfrastructure initiative that will establish the world's most comprehensive open-source platform for policy microsimulation and economic research. Building on our successful NSF POSE Phase I foundation, this CSSI Frameworks project will create scalable, cloud-native infrastructure that enables researchers, policymakers, and educators to conduct sophisticated policy analysis with unprecedented speed, transparency, and accessibility.

## Cyberinfrastructure Innovation

Our proposed infrastructure addresses critical gaps in computational policy research by introducing a unified, modern stack:
- **Production-Grade Rules Engine**: We provide a proven, vectorized microsimulation core that already models federal/state taxes and benefits (SNAP, Medicaid, TANF), validated against NBER's TAXSIM and the Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database.
- **Real-Time Policy APIs**: Our sub-second response times for interactive policy analysis enable real-time feedback loops for researchers and policymakers.
- **Federated Data Infrastructure**: We ensure privacy-preserving access to survey microdata across institutions, overcoming traditional data access barriers.
- **Reproducible Research Platform**: By using containerized environments with version-controlled policy parameters, we guarantee that every simulation is fully reproducible.

## Research Impact

This infrastructure enables a new class of **Hyper-Local, Dynamic, and Long-Term (HLDL)** economic modeling. By fusing disparate datasets into a unified, open-source framework, we enable researchers to:
-   **Bridge the Micro-Macro Divide**: Researchers can finally integrate sub-annual income volatility (critical for safety net design) with centennial-scale solvency projections (critical for Social Security), calibrated to official SSA Trustees Reports through 2100.
-   **Analyze Policy at the Congressional District Level**: Leveraging our nationally integrated microdata file, calibrated to every state and district, users can reveal the local impacts of federal reforms.
-   **Democratize Complex Modeling**: We provide the first open-source alternative to proprietary government models (e.g., DynaSim, CBOLT), allowing independent researchers to reproduce official scores and test novel reforms.

## Broader Impacts

PolicyEngine cyberinfrastructure will democratize access to advanced policy analysis tools, support evidence-based policymaking, and enhance economic policy education. Our commitment to open-source development and inclusive community building ensures broad accessibility and sustainable impact across diverse user communities.

## Team and Timeline

Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in microsimulation modeling, software engineering, and cyberinfrastructure development. Over four years, we will deliver a production-ready platform serving thousands of researchers while establishing sustainable governance and funding models for long-term operation.
