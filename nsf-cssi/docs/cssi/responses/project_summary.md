## Overview

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - This section should provide a compelling 1-page summary of the entire CSSI Elements proposal]*

PolicyEngine represents a transformative cyberinfrastructure initiative that will establish the world's most comprehensive open-source platform for policy microsimulation and economic research. Building on our successful NSF POSE Phase I foundation, this CSSI Frameworks project will create scalable, cloud-native infrastructure that enables researchers, policymakers, and educators to conduct sophisticated policy analysis with unprecedented speed, transparency, and accessibility.

## Cyberinfrastructure Innovation

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - Highlight the technical innovations and infrastructure gaps being addressed]*

Our proposed infrastructure addresses critical gaps in computational policy research:
- **Production-Grade Rules Engine**: A proven, vectorized microsimulation core that already models federal/state taxes and benefits (SNAP, Medicaid, TANF), validated against NBER's TAXSIM and the Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database.
- **Real-Time Policy APIs**: Sub-second response times for interactive policy analysis
- **Federated Data Infrastructure**: Privacy-preserving access to survey microdata across institutions
- **Reproducible Research Platform**: Containerized environments with version-controlled policy parameters

## Research Impact

This infrastructure will enable new research frontiers across multiple domains, headlined by the **first open-source dynamic microsimulation model for Social Security**. By providing the computational plumbing for synthetic panel construction and massive-scale calibration, PolicyEngine enables researchers to:

-   **Validate and Reproduce Official Forecasts**: Independently verify Social Security solvency projections and distributional impacts, currently restricted to closed-source government models (e.g., SSA's MINT, CBO's CBOLT).
-   **Model Lifetime Policy Incidence**: Analyze how climate change policies, education reforms, and healthcare changes affect economic outcomes over a full life course, not just a single year.
-   **Democratize Complex Modeling**: Allow students and independent researchers to run sophisticated longitudinal simulations that previously required access to restricted administrative data and proprietary mainframes.

## Broader Impacts

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - Connect to NSF's broader impacts criteria]*

PolicyEngine cyberinfrastructure will democratize access to advanced policy analysis tools, support evidence-based policymaking, and enhance economic policy education. Our commitment to open-source development and inclusive community building ensures broad accessibility and sustainable impact across diverse user communities.

## Team and Timeline

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - Brief overview of team expertise and 4-year timeline]*

Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in microsimulation modeling, software engineering, and cyberinfrastructure development. Over four years, we will deliver a production-ready platform serving thousands of researchers while establishing sustainable governance and funding models for long-term operation.
