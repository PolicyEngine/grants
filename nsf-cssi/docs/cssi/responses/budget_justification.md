# Budget Justification

**Total Request: $2,498,500 over 4 Years**

This proposal employs a **Distributed Framework** budget strategy. PolicyEngine (Lead) retains approximately 60% of funds for core engineering, while 40% is distributed to academic sub-awardees to drive validation, domain adoption, and curriculum integration.

## A. Senior Personnel ($600,000)
*   **Max Ghenis (PI)**: 2.0 summer months/year. Project Director, responsible for architectural oversight and open-source governance.
*   **Ben Ogorek (Co-PI)**: 3.0 summer months/year. Lead Statistician for `microimpute` methodology.
*   **John Sabelhaus (Senior Advisor)**: 1.0 month/year. Scientific Lead for Social Security modeling.

## B. Other Personnel ($800,000)
*   **Core Engineering Team**: Funding for 2 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) engineers/data scientists over the first 2 years, aligning with the "4 highly qualified people" resource model recommended for building a production-grade Social Security model.
    *   *Senior Research Engineer*: Responsible for vectorizing the complex Social Security rules engine.
    *   *Data Scientist*: Responsible for the longitudinal imputation pipeline (`microimpute`).

## C. Fringe Benefits ($420,000)
Calculated at 30% of salary.

## D. Equipment ($0)
We leverage cloud infrastructure; no permanent equipment >$5,000 is requested.

## E. Travel ($60,000)
*   **Annual PI Meeting**: Attendance at NSF CSSI grantee meetings (Alexandria, VA).
*   **Scientific Conferences**: Presentation of results at NBER, AEA, and APPAM conferences.
*   **Partner Summits**: Annual in-person coordination with sub-awardees.

## F. Participant Support Costs ($100,000)
*   **Hackathons & Workshops**: Stipends for graduate students attending annual "PolicyEngine Developer Summits."
*   **Fellowships**: Small grants for PhD students contributing core modules.

## G. Other Direct Costs ($200,000)
*   **Cloud Computing (AWS/GCP)**: $50k/year for training QRF models and hosting public APIs.
*   **Software Licenses**: Collaboration tools (GitHub Enterprise, Slack, Zoom).

## H. Sub-awards ($318,500)
**Strategic Academic Partnerships**:
*   **University Partner A (e.g., Georgetown)**: $100k/year for years 2-4. Validation of microsimulation results against administrative baselines.
*   **University Partner B (e.g., UC Berkeley)**: $100k/year for years 3-4. Curriculum integration and "PolicyEngine-Climate" module development.

## I. Indirect Costs ($0)
PolicyEngine has a negotiated indirect cost rate of [Rate]%. (Placeholder: If no rate, we use the de minimis 10%).
*Note: For this draft, we have allocated indirects into the direct lines for simplicity, to be refined with the fiscal sponsor.*
