# Letter Request: Atlanta Fed (Policy Rules Database)

**To:** [Contact TBD]
**Subject:** Letter of collaboration - NSF CSSI Elements proposal
**Priority:** Medium

[Name],

We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 to build continuous validation infrastructure for PolicyEngine, including comparisons against the Atlanta Fed Policy Rules Database.

Would the Atlanta Fed provide a brief collaboration letter? NSF requires a specific one-sentence format:

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'PolicyEngine Core: Open Tax-Benefit Rules Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta will provide access to the Policy Rules Database for validation comparisons."*

Happy to discuss the validation approach in more detail.

Best,
Max
