**FOLLOW-UP (original request already sent)**

Matt,

Quick follow-up on my earlier note—had another thought:

1. **Paid consultant role**: Given your Census background with the NEWS project and your ongoing PolicyEngine work for IRP, would you be interested in joining as a paid consultant? You're uniquely positioned to help us think through population-scale applications and potential Census integration.

2. **Letter language**: If you're open to it, here's updated language that reflects this broader role:

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'Scalable Policy Microsimulation Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. I will serve as a paid consultant providing feedback on PolicyEngine's tax-benefit calculations, validation methodology, and potential applications for population-scale analysis. My prior work at the Census Bureau on the National Experimental Well-being Statistics (NEWS) project, combined with my ongoing PolicyEngine-based research, positions me to advise on integration with large-scale administrative and survey data systems."*

Totally fine to use the simpler version from my first email if you prefer—just wanted to flag the option.

Thanks,
Max
