# Letter Request: Matthew Unrath (USC)

**To:** Matthew Unrath, USC
**Subject:** Letter of collaboration - NSF CSSI Elements proposal
**Priority:** High (academic research user - MTRs with admin data)

Matt,

We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 for PolicyEngine core infrastructure improvements - specifically native scenario branching (for things like credit vs. deduction elections, AMT), validation pipelines, and performance optimization.

Given your research using PolicyEngine for marginal tax rate calculations with administrative data, would you be willing to provide a brief letter of collaboration? NSF requires a very specific format - essentially one sentence stating intent to collaborate, with no endorsement language:

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'Scalable Policy Microsimulation Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. I will provide feedback on PolicyEngine's marginal tax rate calculations and scenario branching capabilities based on my research using the system with administrative data."*

That's the complete letter - NSF explicitly prohibits anything more elaborate. Happy to adjust the wording to better reflect your work.

Thank you,
Max
