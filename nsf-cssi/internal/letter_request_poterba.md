# Letter Request: James Poterba (NBER President)

**To:** James Poterba, President, NBER
**Subject:** Brief collaboration letter - NSF CSSI Elements (Dec 1 deadline)
**Priority:** High (institutional prestige + research community reach beyond TAXSIM)

**Strategic value:** Poterba's letter signals NBER institutional backing and can emphasize PolicyEngine's value for research BEYOND what TAXSIM offers - benefit programs, policy counterfactuals, reform analysis. This positions PolicyEngine as infrastructure for the next generation of policy research.

Jim,

Following our MOU discussions, we're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal ($568K/3yr) by December 1 focused on PolicyEngine core infrastructure.

Beyond the TAXSIM validation work with Dan Feenberg, I'm hoping NBER might provide a brief collaboration letter that speaks to PolicyEngine's broader value to the economics research community - particularly for research that goes beyond TAXSIM's scope:

- **Benefit program analysis** (SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, housing) - areas TAXSIM doesn't cover
- **Policy counterfactuals and reform analysis** - TAXSIM calculates taxes under current law; PolicyEngine enables "what if" scenarios
- **Integrated tax-benefit analysis** - understanding how tax and benefit programs interact

NSF requires a specific one-sentence format (no endorsement language):

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'Scalable Policy Microsimulation Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate and commit resources as detailed in the Project Description. NBER will facilitate connections between PolicyEngine and the economics research community for validation feedback and research applications in tax-benefit policy analysis."*

Happy to adjust the wording. The key message would be NBER's interest in PolicyEngine as research infrastructure for the broader policy research community, complementing TAXSIM for areas it doesn't cover.

Thank you for the continued partnership.

Max
