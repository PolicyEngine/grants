# Letter Request: Dan Feenberg (NBER/TAXSIM)

**To:** Dan Feenberg
**Subject:** Letter of collaboration - NSF CSSI Elements proposal
**Priority:** High (most directly relevant to validation work)

---

Dan,

We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 for PolicyEngine core infrastructure, including continuous validation against TAXSIM.

Would you provide a brief letter of collaboration? NSF requires a specific format - essentially one sentence stating intent to collaborate, with no endorsement language:

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'PolicyEngine Core: Open Tax-Benefit Rules Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. Specifically, I will provide technical guidance on TAXSIM validation methodology and serve on the project advisory committee."*

---

That's the entire letter - NSF explicitly prohibits anything more elaborate. Happy to adjust the wording.

Thank you,
Max
