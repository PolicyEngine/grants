# Letter Request: Dan Feenberg (NBER/TAXSIM)

**To:** Dan Feenberg
**Subject:** Letter of collaboration + paid consulting - NSF CSSI Elements proposal (Dec 1 deadline)
**Priority:** Critical - TAXSIM validation is core to proposal

---

Dan,

We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 for PolicyEngine infrastructure modernization. The proposal centers on building continuous validation pipelines against TAXSIM, plus performance optimization and R/Stata interfaces for economists.

**Paid consulting opportunity**: We've budgeted $12,000 over 3 years ($4,000/year) for expert consulting from you on validation methodology. This would cover approximately 20 hours/year at $200/hour for:
- Guidance on validation methodology and accuracy benchmarks
- Documentation of undocumented TAXSIM behaviors and edge cases
- Review of validation pipeline design
- Resolution of discrepancies between PolicyEngine and TAXSIM

This is separate from your advisory role and reflects the specialized expertise you'd provide. Let me know if this rate/scope works for you, or if you'd prefer to continue as unpaid advisor only.

**Letter of collaboration**: Either way, would you provide a brief letter? NSF prefers a specific format:

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'Scalable Policy Microsimulation Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. Specifically, I will provide technical guidance on TAXSIM validation methodology [as a paid consultant / and continue serving as project advisor]."*

I've attached the draft proposal for context. Would welcome any feedback, though I know timing is tight.

Given the Monday deadline (and Thanksgiving), even a quick reply by Friday would be enormously helpful.

Thank you,
Max
