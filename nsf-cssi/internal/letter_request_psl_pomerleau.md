# Letter Request: PSL Tax-Calculator (Kyle Pomerleau / AEI)

**To:** Kyle Pomerleau (American Enterprise Institute / Policy Simulation Library)
**Subject:** Letter of collaboration - NSF CSSI Elements proposal (Dec 1 deadline)
**Priority:** High - cross-validation strengthens both projects

Kyle,

We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 for PolicyEngine infrastructure modernization. A key component is continuous validation infrastructure, and we'd like to include cross-validation against Tax-Calculator.

**What we're proposing**: Automated comparison of PolicyEngine against Tax-Calculator for federal income and payroll tax calculations. Since Tax-Calculator already has extensive TAXSIM validation, comparing our results against yours creates a web of cross-checks that benefits the entire open-source tax modeling ecosystem.

**Why this benefits Tax-Calculator**: Any discrepancies we find could reveal edge cases in either model. We'd share all comparison results publicly, and the validation pipeline infrastructure could be adapted for Tax-Calculator's own use.

**Ecosystem benefit**: This multi-model validation approach—comparing PolicyEngine, TAXSIM, Tax-Calculator, and Yale's Tax-Simulator—creates independent verification that increases confidence across all open-source tax models.

**Letter of collaboration**: Would you provide a brief letter? NSF prefers a specific format:

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'Scalable Policy Microsimulation Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. Specifically, I will support cross-validation efforts between PolicyEngine and Tax-Calculator, sharing technical insights to ensure accurate federal income and payroll tax calculations across both models."*

I've attached the draft proposal for context. Given the Monday deadline (and Thanksgiving), a reply by Friday would be extremely helpful.

Thank you,
Max
