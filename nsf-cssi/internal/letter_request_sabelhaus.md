**To:** John Sabelhaus

**Priority:** Critical - advisor credibility

John,

Thanks for agreeing to advise on PolicyEngine. We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 for infrastructure modernization—continuous validation pipelines, performance optimization for population-scale microsimulation, and R/Stata interfaces.

Would you provide a brief collaboration letter as advisory committee member? NSF prefers this format:

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'Scalable Policy Microsimulation Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. I will serve on the project advisory committee, providing guidance on microsimulation methodology, tax modeling validation, and research community adoption."*

That's the complete letter.

I've attached the draft proposal for context. Would welcome any feedback, though I know timing is tight.

Given the Monday deadline (and Thanksgiving), even a quick reply by Friday would be very helpful.

Thank you,
Max
