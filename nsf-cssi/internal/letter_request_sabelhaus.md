**To:** John Sabelhaus

**Priority:** High (already committed)

John,

Thanks for agreeing to advise. We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1.

Would you provide a brief collaboration letter as advisory committee member? NSF requires this exact format (no endorsements allowed):

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'PolicyEngine Core: Open Tax-Benefit Rules Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. I will serve on the project advisory committee, providing guidance on tax modeling methodology and microsimulation validation."*

That's the complete letter - NSF prohibits anything more. Thank you!

Max
