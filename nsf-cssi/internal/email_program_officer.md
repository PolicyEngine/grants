Dr. Chandola,

I'm preparing an NSF CSSI Elements proposal for the December 1 deadline and wanted to briefly confirm fit with the program.

PolicyEngine is an open-source tax-benefit microsimulation engine (POSE Phase I awardee, Award #2229069). We're proposing core infrastructure work:

1. **Scenario branching** - Native support for tax provisions requiring calculation under multiple alternatives (credit vs. deduction elections, AMT, Social Security trust fund accounting)

2. **Continuous validation** - Automated pipelines comparing against TAXSIM (NBER, MOU in place) and Atlanta Fed Policy Rules Database

3. **Performance optimization** - Enable population-scale simulation (100M+ tax units)

The system currently serves 100,000+ users annually including congressional staff (JEC), UK government (Cabinet Office/HM Treasury), and academic researchers.

Is this appropriate for Elements, or would you suggest a different track? Happy to discuss by email or schedule a brief call.

Best regards,
Max Ghenis
PolicyEngine (PSL Foundation)
