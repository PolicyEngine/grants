# Letter Request: Jeremy Barofsky (Georgetown Better Government Lab)

**To:** Jeremy Barofsky, Executive Director, Better Government Lab, Georgetown University
**Subject:** Letter of collaboration - NSF CSSI Elements proposal
**Priority:** High (academic research user - takeup research with admin data)

---

Jeremy,

We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 for PolicyEngine core infrastructure improvements - specifically native scenario branching, validation pipelines, and performance optimization for population-scale simulation.

Given the Better Government Lab's research using PolicyEngine for benefit takeup analysis with administrative data, would you be willing to provide a brief letter of collaboration? NSF requires a very specific format - essentially one sentence stating intent to collaborate, with no endorsement language:

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'PolicyEngine Core: Open Tax-Benefit Rules Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. The Better Government Lab at Georgetown University will provide feedback on PolicyEngine's benefit program calculations and validation methodology based on our research using the system with administrative data."*

That's the complete letter - NSF explicitly prohibits anything more elaborate. Happy to adjust the wording to better reflect your team's work.

Thank you,
Max
