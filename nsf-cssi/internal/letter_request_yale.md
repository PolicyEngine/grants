# Letter Request: Yale Budget Lab Tax-Simulator (John Ricco)

**To:** John Ricco (Yale Budget Lab)
**Subject:** Letter of collaboration - NSF CSSI Elements proposal (Dec 1 deadline)
**Priority:** High - cross-validation strengthens both projects

John,

We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 for PolicyEngine infrastructure modernization. A key component is continuous validation infrastructure, and we'd like to include cross-validation against Tax-Simulator.

**What we're proposing**: Automated comparison of PolicyEngine (Python) against Tax-Simulator (R) for federal tax calculations. Cross-validating across different implementations and languages provides independent verification that increases confidence in both models.

**Why this helps Budget Lab**: Any discrepancies we find could reveal edge cases in either model. We'd share all comparison results publicly. This also demonstrates the kind of rigorous validation that supports academic research credibility.

**Mutual benefit**: We're also building R interfaces for PolicyEngine (CRAN package). We could share learnings about R packaging for tax microsimulation tools.

**Letter of collaboration**: Would you provide a brief letter? NSF prefers a specific format:

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'Scalable Policy Microsimulation Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. Specifically, I will support cross-validation efforts between PolicyEngine and Tax-Simulator, sharing technical insights to ensure accurate federal tax calculations across both models."*

I've attached the draft proposal for context. Given the Monday deadline (and Thanksgiving), a reply by Friday would be extremely helpful.

Thank you,
Max
