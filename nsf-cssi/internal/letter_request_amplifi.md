Jill,

We're submitting an NSF CSSI Elements proposal by December 1 for PolicyEngine infrastructure modernization—continuous validation pipelines, performance optimization, and R/Stata interfaces for researchers.

Amplifi's Benefit Navigator integration with PolicyEngine represents exactly the kind of validation feedback loop we're building infrastructure to support. Your team and users surface edge cases, policy updates, and real-world scenarios that improve the accuracy of our benefit rules—especially for California programs. This ground-truth validation is invaluable.

Would you provide a brief letter of collaboration? NSF prefers this format:

---

*"If the proposal submitted by Max Ghenis entitled 'Scalable Policy Microsimulation Infrastructure' is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description. Amplifi's Benefit Navigator uses PolicyEngine's benefit rules engine to serve California families, and our team regularly provides feedback on edge cases and policy updates that improve model accuracy. We will continue contributing to validation efforts through our production use."*

That's the complete letter. Happy to adjust the wording to better reflect your work and relationship with PolicyEngine. Happy to share the draft proposal if you'd like context, but the letter itself is just the one sentence above.

Given the Monday deadline (and Thanksgiving), even a quick reply by Friday would be very helpful.

Thank you,
Max
