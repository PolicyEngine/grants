Subject: Inquiry re: CSSI Frameworks Track Fit - PolicyEngine

Dear Dr. Pierce,

I am writing to confirm the track appropriateness for our upcoming CSSI proposal.

**Project:** PolicyEngine Cyberinfrastructure
**Track:** Framework Implementations
**Budget:** ~$2.5M over 4 years

Our project builds open-source infrastructure for **dynamic economic microsimulation**. It creates a scalable, cloud-native framework used by economists and policymakers to model complex systems (taxes, benefits, climate impact) over long time horizons.

**Structure:** To ensure sustainability and community adoption, we are proposing a "Distributed Framework" model:
*   **Core Cyberinfrastructure**: Developed by PolicyEngine (non-profit research org).
*   **Validation & Integration**: ~40% of the budget is allocated to sub-awards for academic partners (Georgetown, Berkeley) who will validate the scientific accuracy of the models and integrate them into graduate curricula.

Does this "Hub-and-Spoke" structure, with a non-profit lead and significant academic sub-awards, fit the goals of the **Framework Implementations** track? We believe this is the most robust path to sustainability for this specific domain.

Thank you for your time and guidance.

Best,
Max Ghenis
CEO, PolicyEngine
