Subject: Re: Social Security model - NSF CSSI Strategy ($2.5M)

Hi John,

Thanks again for the "So, you want to build a Social Security model?" white paper. It has been our north star in planning the NSF proposal.

We are targeting the **NSF CSSI Frameworks** track with a **$2.5M budget** (4 years). This aligns directly with your "4 experts for 2 years" resource estimate (~$1.6M for core team), while leaving room for academic partners to handle validation.

**The Strategy: "Distributed Framework"**
To mitigate the operational risk of a single non-profit taking on such a complex task, we are structuring this as a hub-and-spoke model:
*   **PolicyEngine (Hub)**: Core engineering team (2 FTE engineers + Data Scientist) building the `microimpute` (QRF) and `microcalibrate` (Gradient Descent) infrastructure.
*   **Partners (Spokes)**: Sub-awards to university labs (e.g., Georgetown, Berkeley) to perform the rigorous validation (RCTs/comparisons) you emphasized.

**Your Role**
We have budgeted for your role as **Senior Advisor / Scientific Lead** (1 month/year) to guide the scientific requirements and ensure we aren't just "building another black box."

Does this structure—and the $2.5M target—sound credible to you? If so, we'd love to move forward with listing you as Senior Personnel.

Best,
Max
