Subject: Inquiry re: CSSI Frameworks Proposal - Open Source Cyberinfrastructure for Economic Policy

Dear Dr. Ferrell and Dr. Lutz,

I am writing to inquire about the fit of a potential **CSSI Framework Implementation** proposal within the SBE directorate's priorities.

**The Project:** PolicyEngine is developing open-source cyberinfrastructure to solve the "Grand Challenge" of dynamic economic microsimulation. Currently, modeling the lifetime impact of policy reforms (e.g., Social Security solvency, climate adaptation) relies on closed-source, legacy models (like DynaSim or CBOLT) that are inaccessible to the broader scientific community.

**The Innovation:** We propose a **Hyper-Local, Dynamic, and Long-Term (HLDL)** framework that fuses:
1.  **High-Performance Computing**: Vectorized simulation of complex statutory rules (US Code).
2.  **Machine Learning**: Quantile Regression Forests for generating synthetic longitudinal panels from public cross-sectional data (bypassing restricted administrative data bottlenecks).
3.  **Differentiable Calibration**: Gradient-descent optimization to align models with thousands of local administrative targets.

**The Ask:** We are targeting the **$2.5M Frameworks** track to fund a distributed team (PolicyEngine as the engineering hub, with university partners for validation).

Does SBE view the democratization of this class of economic modeling—moving from "black box" government estimates to reproducible open science—as a priority for the CSSI program?

We would value any guidance you could provide.

Best regards,
Max Ghenis
CEO, PolicyEngine
