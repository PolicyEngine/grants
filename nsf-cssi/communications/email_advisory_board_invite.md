Subject: Invitation: Scientific Advisory Board for PolicyEngine's NSF Cyberinfrastructure

Hi [Name],

Following up on our recent conversation about the future of Social Security modeling.

PolicyEngine is submitting a proposal to the **NSF Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI)** program to build the first open-source, dynamic microsimulation model for the US safety net and retirement system.

We are forming a **Scientific Advisory Board** to ensure this infrastructure serves the real needs of the policy community, not just technical curiosity. Given your expertise at [Organization], your guidance would be invaluable in defining the "success metrics" for this public good.

**Commitment:**
*   Quarterly virtual meetings to review model development and validation results.
*   Advising on key policy scenarios (e.g., solvency reforms, SSI interactions) that the model must handle.
*   (Optional) Beta testing the interface before public release.

We are not asking for a sub-award or heavy lifting—just your strategic insight to keep us honest.

Would you be open to serving on this board? If so, we can draft a brief Letter of Collaboration for the proposal.

Best,
Max Ghenis
CEO, PolicyEngine
