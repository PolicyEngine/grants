# Project Summary

**Title: PolicyEngine: Building an Open Ecosystem for Tax-Benefit Microsimulation**

## Overview

PolicyEngine proposes to establish an open-source ecosystem (OSE) for **tax-benefit microsimulation** that democratizes access to policy analysis tools currently restricted to a dozen well-resourced institutions. Our platform enables any organization—from state legislatures to community colleges to benefits navigators—to analyze how tax and transfer policies affect their constituents. Building on our Phase I award (#2434925) and proven adoption by the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, UK Cabinet Office, and major research institutions, we will develop the governance, training infrastructure, and contributor pathways necessary to sustain this critical public infrastructure.

The ecosystem addresses an urgent democratic need: policy decisions affecting trillions in spending rely on proprietary models costing millions annually to operate. State and local governments, which implement most safety net programs, lack tools to analyze policy interactions. Universities cannot teach students using real models. Community organizations cannot verify benefit eligibility. PolicyEngine transforms this landscape by providing free, transparent, validated microsimulation that matches institutional-grade accuracy while enabling universal access.

## Intellectual Merit

This project advances computational social science by creating the first fully open infrastructure for tax-benefit microsimulation with three key innovations:

1. **Validated transparency**: Our models achieve 96% agreement with NBER's TAXSIM across thousands of test cases while exposing every calculation step, enabling researchers to verify and extend analyses.

2. **Modular ecosystem architecture**: Separation of rules engines, data enhancement, and analysis tools allows specialized communities to maintain components while ensuring system coherence.

3. **Reproducible policy research**: Every PolicyEngine analysis includes shareable links with full parameters, enabling exact replication and systematic meta-analysis of policy proposals.

## Broader Impacts

The OSE will transform policy analysis through four pathways:

**Democratized Access**: Organizations currently excluded from microsimulation—state legislatures, community colleges, local governments—gain sophisticated analytical capabilities. A USC researcher reports PolicyEngine enabled their marginal tax rate research that "would not be possible without a fully open tax-benefit rules engine."

**Educational Integration**: We will develop curriculum modules for economics and public policy programs, with committed adoption at USC, Georgetown, and through NBER's network. Students will learn using the same tools that analyze real legislation.

**Benefits Access**: Our partnership with MyFriendBen (backed by $2.4M from Gates Foundation) and multiple similar organizations demonstrates immediate impact—identifying hundreds of millions in unclaimed benefits. The open rules engine enables any organization to build eligibility screening tools.

**State/Local Capacity**: Through partnerships with NCSL and direct engagement with state legislators, we address massive unmet demand for policy analysis at the state level, where most safety net programs are administered but analytical capacity is minimal.
