The funds will be used over a 21-month period (December 2024 - August 2026) to strengthen PolicyEngine's technical infrastructure and expand its state-level policy modeling capabilities. This investment will enable PolicyEngine to serve as the technical backbone for MyFriendBen's national expansion, helping low-income individuals and families under 200% FPL access benefits across multiple states. The funding will cover engineering staff time, cloud computing resources, and technical assistance needed to maintain the rules engine and support implementation in new states.

The MyFriendBen project is designed to reach individuals and families under 200% FPL across 5 states (Colorado, North Carolina, Massachusetts + two additional states) through 2026:
- 185,000 households impacted
- $2B in total benefit value reported
- $70M projected value for households
