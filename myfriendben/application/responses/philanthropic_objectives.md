PolicyEngine is a close national technical partner to MyFriendBen, a robust universal, open-source benefit screener. PolicyEngine provides an open source federal benefits and tax credit rules engine that powers several of MyFriendBen's eligibility calculations. Together, the MyFriendBen and PolicyEngine teams work closely together to continuously add to and sharpen the rules engine that PolicyEngine maintains. This grant is intended to enable PolicyEngine's ongoing development of tools and maintenance of the existing open source rules engine, in addition to supporting tasks related to MyFriendBen's scaling to three new states starting in 2025 (in addition to Colorado and North Carolina).
