PolicyEngine delivered all contracted deliverables while exceeding expectations. We maintained 100% API uptime, surpassing the 99.9% target, and kept our open-source rules engine current for all federal programs (SNAP, WIC, Lifeline, NSLP, SSI, EITC, CTC, Medicaid).

We completed implementation for MyFriendBen's three expansion states—Illinois, Massachusetts, and Texas—modeling state tax credits, TANF, CCDF, and SSI supplements matching Colorado and North Carolina detail. The API handled production queries from all five states within the 50,000 monthly allocation.

Beyond baseline deliverables, we enhanced program logic based on partner feedback, improving student SNAP and SSI spousal deeming rules to address real-world edge cases.

Technical assistance exceeded 500 person-hours through monthly meetings, ad-hoc consultations, and Slack support.

No pivots were required. The primary challenge involved balancing rule complexity with API performance, resolved through optimization.
