At the midpoint (12 months), PolicyEngine has spent $200,000 of the $300,000 grant. Primary expenditures to date:

**Engineering Contracts**: Ziming Hua and Pavel Makarchuk implemented state-specific benefit rules for Illinois, Massachusetts, and Texas, plus enhanced federal program logic.

**API Operations**: Anthony Volk maintained household API infrastructure, achieving 100% uptime.

**Health Policy**: Partial support for Daphne Hansell on Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA modeling.

**Leadership**: Partial support for Max Ghenis on coordination, technical assistance, and strategic planning.

**Infrastructure**: Server costs (~$5,000/month, partially allocated across US/UK projects) for API hosting and rules engine operations.

Remaining $100,000 will support final 9 months: continued maintenance, technical assistance, and infrastructure through August 2026.
