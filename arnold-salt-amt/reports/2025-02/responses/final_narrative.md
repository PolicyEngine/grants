PolicyEngine completed all deliverables, launching SALTernative (policyengine.org/us/salternative)—a free, open-source tool for analyzing SALT and AMT reform options.

**Model Enhancements**

We built a TAXSIM emulator with an interactive dashboard (policyengine.github.io/policyengine-taxsim) that compares aggregate alignment to TAXSIM and examines individual tax filers and calculated fields. The emulator enabled systematic validation of PolicyEngine's federal and state tax calculations against TAXSIM outputs. This work later contributed to PolicyEngine's memorandum of understanding with the National Bureau of Economic Research (policyengine.org/us/research/policyengine-nber-mou-taxsim, September 2025).

**SALTernative Launch (April 2025)**

We launched SALTernative (policyengine.org/us/salternative, policyengine.org/us/research/introducing-salternative, April 21, 2025), a Streamlit calculator deployed to Google Cloud Run and integrated into PolicyEngine.org. The tool provides a personal calculator for household-level tax impacts and a nationwide impacts analyzer for distributional and budget analysis. Users can model TCJA extension scenarios, adjust SALT caps and AMT parameters, and incorporate CBO labor supply elasticities.

**Outreach and Analysis (April-May 2025)**

Arnold Ventures and PolicyEngine co-hosted a webinar on April 24, 2025, demonstrating the tool to congressional staff. We published analysis of SALT and AMT interactions in H.R.1 (policyengine.org/us/research/managers-amendment-to-hr1, May 2025), examining the Manager's Amendment's SALT cap expansion and AMT parameter changes.

**Impact**

Arnold Ventures published "Interactions Between the SALT Deduction and AMT Exemption" (arnoldventures.org/resources/interactions-between-the-salt-deduction-and-amt-exemption, May 2025) using PolicyEngine's analysis.

All $94,800 supported engineering, data infrastructure, and documentation exclusively for this purpose.
