The tax policy analysis field shifted dramatically during the grant period as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, H.R.1) became central to congressional debate in 2025. This legislation extended and modified TCJA provisions, creating unprecedented demand for real-time tax modeling tools that could analyze complex interactions between provisions. SALTernative addressed this need by enabling instant analysis of SALT cap and AMT scenarios that previously required weeks of custom analysis from economics teams.

Open-source tax microsimulation gained legitimacy as a complement to proprietary models. PolicyEngine's NBER partnership signals growing acceptance of transparent, community-validated tools in academic research. Our TAXSIM emulator demonstrates that open-source approaches can match academic standards while dramatically improving accessibility for researchers, journalists, and the public.

Congressional engagement with technical tools increased substantially. The success of our April 24 webinar and direct use of SALTernative by Hill staff demonstrates growing comfort with interactive policy analysis during legislative deliberations. Arnold Ventures' report citing PolicyEngine analysis further legitimized data-driven approaches to tax reform debates.

SALTernative democratized SALT-AMT analysis that was previously accessible only to think tanks with dedicated economics teams. Researchers, journalists, and individual households can now explore reform scenarios at policyengine.org/us/salternative, enabling broader participation in tax policy debates and more informed public discourse on OBBBA and future tax reform options.
