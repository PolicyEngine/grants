SALTernative achieved significant adoption among policymakers and researchers beyond initial expectations. The April 24, 2025 congressional webinar attracted Hill staff from both chambers, who used the tool to analyze H.R.1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) scenarios in real time. Arnold Ventures' May 2025 report citing our analysis validated the tool's technical rigor and demonstrated its value for policy development.

The TAXSIM emulator exceeded initial goals, leading to a formal partnership with NBER announced in September 2025. This partnership established PolicyEngine as the successor platform for tax microsimulation research. The interactive dashboard at policyengine.github.io/policyengine-taxsim enabled researchers to systematically identify calculation discrepancies, improving accuracy for both PolicyEngine and TAXSIM.

Development took longer than initially projected as we refined concepts and methods not included in the original proposal. Landing on the "effective SALT cap" concept proved to be the turning point—this framework clarified how the AMT creates an implicit cap even without a statutory limit. Showing how effective SALT caps vary with income became central to the tool's analytical power, but required extensive development and validation beyond the initial scope.

The technical complexity of SALT-AMT interactions required deeper modeling than initially scoped. Behavioral responses to capital gains timing, AMT phase-outs, and state tax conformity rules demanded additional development time but strengthened the final product's accuracy and policy relevance.
