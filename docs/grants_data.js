Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group must independently build and maintain document libraries\u2014duplicating effort while links break and documents vanish. As the leading open-source rules engine powering tools helping over 100,000 Americans, PolicyEngine has seen how this foundational problem cripples the entire ecosystem. PolicyEngine Atlas solves this once, for everyone.\n\nBuilding on pilots with the Atlanta Fed, Atlas will be the first comprehensive, AI-powered archive of safety net policy documents. We'll retrieve, store, and continuously update thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals across 50 states\u2014preventing the link rot and document loss plaguing benefit delivery.\n\nAtlas goes beyond preservation. By integrating with PolicyEngine's proven rules engine, we transform static documents into a semantic knowledge graph revealing connections between programs and jurisdictions. This enables caseworkers to verify eligibility pathways with source documents, researchers to trace policy evolution, and AI tools to access authoritative sources through our web app, API, and MCP server.\n\nTo reduce administrative burden, we'll introduce the Clarity Index\u2014a scoring system that combines human expertise with AI to analyze Atlas's archived documents and identify which policy language causes errors and delays. Strategic subgrants to government-connected organizations help agencies learn from successful peers, transforming insights into clearer policy communication.\n\nPolicyEngine Atlas creates essential infrastructure for safety net transformation. By providing universal access to clear, computable, authoritative policy documents, we enable the entire ecosystem\u2014from applicants to policymakers\u2014to make our fragmented benefit system work as one.",

Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group works with fragments of the policy landscape\u2014unable to see connections across programs or jurisdictions. When Casetext shut down, thousands of legal aid organizations lost document access overnight. This fragmentation forces each organization to solve the same problem separately, wasting resources.\n\nRules-as-code developers cannot establish authoritative sources for their calculations. While PolicyEngine cites over 2,500 policy URLs, these remain disconnected fragments rather than a semantic system. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator lack direct access to regulatory text behind eligibility determinations\u2014verification requires digging through code rather than referencing documentation. Without a platform connecting computable policies to authoritative documents, tools cannot earn government trust.\n\nThe fragmentation also hides critical eligibility pathways. Categorical eligibility chains exist across programs\u2014TANF enables SNAP, SNAP qualifies for Lifeline, LIHEAP unlocks weatherization\u2014but remain invisible in traditional document search. Caseworkers cannot discover these connections systematically, meaning families miss benefits they qualify for because policies aren't computationally linked.\n\nMeanwhile, unclear policy language drives administrative burden costing billions annually. GAO calls complex regulations \"inherently error-prone,\" creating barriers preventing eligible families from accessing benefits. Yet agencies cannot learn which language patterns work because no infrastructure enables comparison across jurisdictions. States repeat mistakes; improvement remains guesswork.\n\nAs AI tools increasingly assist with benefit navigation, the lack of authoritative sources becomes critical. Large language models cannot reliably explain benefit rules without verified documentation, limiting their potential to help families.",

This flexibility lets agencies adopt Atlas at their own pace using their preferred integration approach.\n\nOur outreach focuses on understanding government document management needs. Through partnerships with MyFriendBen's Colorado agency connections and Benefit Navigator's government relationships, we learn how agencies currently manage policy documents and what barriers prevent clearer communication. These insights shape Atlas development, ensuring our open source solution meets real government needs.\n\nThe integration with PolicyEngine's encoded rules creates unique value for government. When agencies see their documents connected to actual calculations affecting constituents, they understand how unclear language creates errors. Our semantic layer reveals how their policies interact with other programs, surfacing categorical eligibility pathways they may not realize exist. This combination of document management and rules-as-code demonstrates to agencies how modern infrastructure can reduce administrative burden while improving accuracy for the families they serve.",

We offer a free web app and Python package, charge $0.02 per household API request (near cost), and provide Docker images for self-hosting at no charge. This approach established us as the standard open source rules API, generating revenue through feature enhancements (encoding new policies), enterprise support, research projects, and subgrants.\n\nAtlas follows this proven model. By 2027, operational costs will be minimal\u2014primarily cloud storage and occasional document updates. Revenue streams mirror our successful formula: enterprise support for organizations needing guaranteed uptime, contracts to add new program types or jurisdictions, custom metadata integration with specific rules engines, and government contracts for onsite installations supporting clearer policy document assembly and dissemination.\n\nOur mission drives accessibility-first pricing. Basic Atlas access remains free forever, ensuring small nonprofits can benefit. We charge only for premium features that large organizations value: guaranteed response times, custom integrations, priority support. Government agencies will increasingly seek our expertise to modernize their document management workflows, creating sustainable revenue while improving public services.\n\nTechnical efficiency ensures long-term viability. AI training costs decrease as models learn patterns. Community contributions through bounties reduce acquisition costs. Automated monitoring minimizes manual oversight. GitHub's infrastructure handles storage and versioning at minimal cost for 5,000 documents.\n\nThis sustainability model\u2014proven through PolicyEngine's growth to serving over 100,000 Americans\u2014ensures Atlas becomes permanent infrastructure.

        "plainText": "PolicyEngine's mission is to compute the impact of public policy for the world. We build free, open-source microsimulation models that enable anyone\u2014policymakers, researchers, journalists, advocates, and the public\u2014to rigorously analyze how tax and benefit policies affect households and society.\n\nWe work toward a future where evidence-based policy analysis is not a privilege of well-resourced national organizations, but public infrastructure accessible to every community. Today, sophisticated microsimulation capacity concentrates in Washington DC. Smaller metros, rural areas, and regions outside the capital lack the infrastructure to independently analyze how policies affect their communities. This creates geographic inequality in policy knowledge\u2014some places can participate in informed debates about economic mobility policies while others cannot.\n\nOur vision is a world where a state legislator in Alabama can model how a state tax credit affects her district, where a journalist in rural Montana can analyze federal benefit changes for her readers, where a community organization in any city can understand policy impacts on the families they serve, and where benefit navigation tools can provide accurate, real-time information to people seeking support.\n\nPolicyEngine provides infrastructure used by over 100,000 people annually\u2014both policy analysts and individuals experiencing economic insecurity. Organizations serving people with lived experience depend on our calculations: MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help people identify benefits they qualify for; Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our models to support college students facing food and housing insecurity. Simultaneously, policy organizations like Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our tools for analysis.

Our platform enables users to model federal and state programs including income taxes, payroll taxes, the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and dozens of other programs across all 50 states.\n\nWhat We Do:\nWe provide computational infrastructure serving two interconnected communities: organizations helping people navigate benefit systems, and researchers analyzing policy impacts on economic mobility.\n\nOn the direct service side, our API powers benefit access tools used by individuals experiencing economic insecurity. MyFriendBen uses our calculations for benefit eligibility screening. Amplifi's Benefit Navigator depends on our models to provide accurate benefit information. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our tools to serve college students facing food and housing insecurity. These organizations need reliable, real-time calculations\u2014PolicyEngine provides that infrastructure.\n\nOn the policy side, our infrastructure serves users from congressional offices to state legislative staff to community organizations. Staff at the Joint Economic Committee, congressional offices, New York State Senate, and DC Council use our tools for policy analysis\u2014in some cases citing our research when proposing policies like state child tax credits. State-level organizations like Colorado Fiscal Institute depend on our models for analysis. National policy organizations including Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our infrastructure, as do community organizations like Mother's Outreach Network in DC. Academic researchers at institutions including Georgetown and University of Michigan use our tools for economic mobility research. Users can calculate impacts on individual households, understand distributional effects across income groups, estimate budgetary costs, and analyze poverty and inequality changes\u2014all at no cost and without specialized training.\n\nNEO's Impact on Our Sustainability:\nThanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we were able to build the flexible partnership capacity that now sustains our work. That funding enabled us to respond to policy analysis needs across the country and engage organizations that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling\u2014including partnerships with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center.\n\nThese strengthened relationships within the early childhood policy network directly resulted in the Pritzker Children's Initiative supporting our child poverty analysis work specifically. This demonstrates how flexible general operating support enables the relationship-building essential for long-term sustainability. NEO's investment in responsive capacity created focused funding for child poverty work, while the broader partnership infrastructure that made it possible still needs support.\n\nThanks to Arnold Ventures, we now have congressional district-level data capability. Thanks to the National Science Foundation, we're expanding our open-source ecosystem. These investments provide technical infrastructure. This NEO grant would sustain the partnership capacity that enables organizations to actually use that infrastructure.\n\nHow Our Work Leads to Impact:\nOur impact pathway connects infrastructure to use. First, we make sophisticated analysis accessible to those who previously lacked capacity\u2014benefit navigation tools, local journalists, state policy organizations, community groups. Second, this democratized access enables more communities to participate in policy debates with evidence. Third, better-informed debates lead to policies that more effectively address economic mobility, because policymakers understand tradeoffs and communities can hold them accountable with data.\n\nHow We Define Success:\nWe measure success through four dimensions: (1) reach\u2014the number and diversity of organizations using our infrastructure, (2) sustainability\u2014whether organizations develop lasting ability to use our tools independently, (3) influence\u2014instances where our analysis enables decisions that advance economic mobility, and (4) infrastructure quality\u2014whether calculations are accurate, accessible, and continuously improved. Success means MyFriendBen can reliably help someone identify benefits, a small-town newspaper can analyze policy impacts, and a state legislator can understand constituent effects\u2014all using the same rigorous foundation.",

        "plainText": "PolicyEngine recognizes that rigorous quantitative analysis, while essential, tells only part of the story about how policies affect people's lives. We also recognize that we don't represent communities experiencing economic insecurity\u2014we provide infrastructure FOR them. This understanding shapes how we address each of the Fund's research principles:\n\nIntersectional Approach Reflecting Lived Experience:\nOur microsimulation models calculate policy impacts across multiple dimensions\u2014income, household composition, geography, age, and employment status\u2014enabling analysis of how policies affect people with different combinations of circumstances. However, we acknowledge that numbers alone cannot capture intersectional experience.\n\nThis is why partnerships with organizations serving people with lived experience are essential to our work. MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help individuals identify benefits they qualify for\u2014these are tools used by people navigating complex systems, often in crisis. Student Basic Needs Coalition serves college students facing food and housing insecurity. Our local journalism partnerships (which this grant would systematize) add qualitative understanding of what quantitative impacts mean for safety, dignity, and belonging in specific communities. We provide the numbers; our partners contribute the understanding of what those numbers mean.\n\nHonoring Distinct Worldviews:\nPolicyEngine operates as neutral infrastructure. We do not advocate for particular policies; rather, we build tools that communities across the political spectrum can use according to their own values and priorities. This means a conservative think tank analyzing work incentives, a progressive advocacy group examining poverty reduction, and a nonpartisan journalist reporting on constituent impacts can all use the same rigorous foundation but interpret findings through their distinct worldviews. We believe this pluralistic approach honors diverse ways of understanding policy impacts while maintaining analytical integrity.\n\nDemonstrated Partnership with Historically Marginalized Communities:\nWe don't claim to speak for communities experiencing economic insecurity. Instead, we invest in building infrastructure they can use according to their understanding and priorities. Geographic inequality in analysis capacity disproportionately affects regions with concentrations of historically marginalized populations. Our partnership strategy explicitly prioritizes organizations in the American South, smaller metros, and rural areas\u2014precisely the places that lack sophisticated policy analysis infrastructure and where communities of color, Indigenous populations, and low-income families often have limited voice in policy debates.\n\nThanks to NEO's previous support, we successfully engaged organizations that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling, responding to policy analysis needs across the country. This grant would systematize that successful approach. Rather than extracting data from communities, we invest in building their permanent capacity to conduct independent analysis. This means training, technical support, and tools that remain accessible after the grant period ends. Organizations maintain control; we provide infrastructure.\n\nExpansive Understanding Beyond Financial Outcomes:\nPolicyEngine's core competency is calculating financial impacts\u2014poverty rates, income changes, benefit receipt. We excel at answering \"how much money\" questions. But economic mobility encompasses dignity, agency, belonging, and autonomy\u2014dimensions that microsimulation cannot quantify. Our journalism partnerships address this gap.\n\nWhen a local reporter uses our congressional district data showing that 1,200 children would be lifted from poverty, then interviews three families about what stable childcare or predictable income would mean for their lives, the combination captures both financial and human dimensions. The quantitative analysis provides rigor and scale; the storytelling provides context and meaning. Neither alone suffices. This grant would systematize and expand journalism partnerships we've tested informally with NEO's prior support.\n\nInnovative Uses of Qualitative Data:\nThis project systematizes partnerships that pair hyperlocal microsimulation with community storytelling. Thanks to Arnold Ventures' support, we've developed congressional district, state legislative district, and metro area-level analysis capability. By building sustained partnerships with local journalists, we create ongoing space for ethnographic reporting, oral history, and community-designed research questions.\n\nA journalist in Birmingham can ask \"how would this policy affect families in my city?\" then use our tools to identify affected households and tell their stories. The research question originates in the community; PolicyEngine provides analytical infrastructure; and the resulting knowledge combines statistical rigor with human narrative. This is the model NEO's prior flexible support enabled us to test. This grant would systematize it.\n\nOur Commitment:\nWe recognize that PolicyEngine brings technical expertise but not lived experience of economic insecurity or marginalized community membership. Our role is to build infrastructure that communities can use according to their own priorities. This grant would enable us to do that more systematically\u2014providing not just tools, but dedicated staff time for training, relationship-building, and sustained partnership with organizations rooted in communities we serve but do not represent. We commit to moving at the speed of trust, listening to partners about what analysis capabilities they need, and designing support that respects diverse organizational capacities and community contexts.",

MyFriendBen uses our API for benefit eligibility screening. Amplifi's Benefit Navigator relies on our calculations to provide accurate benefit information. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our tools to serve college students facing food and housing insecurity. Thanks to Arnold Ventures' support, we now have congressional district, state legislative district, and metro area-level analysis capability\u2014enabling unprecedented geographic granularity.\n\nThis infrastructure exists. What's missing is sustained capacity to support the organizations that use it.\n\nThanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we were able to respond to partnership needs as they emerged\u2014working with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, which led to Pritzker Children's Initiative funding for child poverty work specifically. We experimented with journalism partnerships, trained organizations without traditional modeling resources, and built relationships that created sustainable funding.\n\nThis grant would systematize and sustain that successful model. Instead of ad-hoc partnerships enabled by flexible funding, we would build permanent capacity to support organizations that depend on PolicyEngine's infrastructure.\n\nThe Capacity We Need to Build:\n\nWithout dedicated staff, even excellent infrastructure goes underutilized. Organizations need training, technical assistance, and relationship management to effectively use sophisticated tools. This is especially true for local journalism, community organizations, and smaller policy groups that lack dedicated data staff.\n\nThis grant would fund one full-time Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator to provide systematic support across three partnership types:\n\nLocal Journalism Partnerships (6 outlets, $36k in mini-grants):\nOur primary focus. Local news outlets serve communities but lack sophisticated policy analysis capacity. We've tested journalism partnerships informally; this grant would systematize the model. The coordinator would:\nTrain journalists to use PolicyEngine tools directly for reporting\nDevelop embeddable calculators that news outlets can integrate into articles, enabling readers to see how policies affect their own household\nProvide technical assistance when outlets cover policy debates\nBuild templates and documentation enabling any outlet to replicate the model\n\nGeographic priority: Southern states, smaller metros, rural areas where local journalism is resource-constrained but serves communities NEO prioritizes.\n\nRegional Policy Organizations (4-5 partners, $18k in mini-grants):\nState-level think tanks, policy coalitions, and research groups across the political spectrum that want to use state legislative district data for analysis but need training and support. These are organizations serving communities that currently lack sophisticated modeling capacity.\n\nCommunity Organizations (2-3 partners, $6k in mini-grants):\nDirect service providers and community organizations serving people experiencing economic insecurity. These groups understand benefit cliff effects and program interactions from daily work with clients, but lack tools to model policy alternatives. The coordinator would provide training and technical assistance enabling them to use PolicyEngine's infrastructure for their communities.\n\nTotal: 12-15 sustained partnerships (not 20 shallow ones). The emphasis is depth and sustainability, not breadth.\n\nWhy This Builds Sustainable Capacity:\n\nThis model creates three forms of sustainability:\nOrganizational sustainability for PolicyEngine: Rather than depending on one-off flexible funding to respond to requests, we build permanent staff capacity for partnership support. The coordinator role becomes an established function, not a temporary project.\nPartner sustainability: Organizations learn to use PolicyEngine's infrastructure independently. Training and technical assistance create lasting capability. When the grant ends, partners retain skills and tools remain freely accessible. We're not creating dependency; we're building capacity.\nField sustainability: Open-source documentation and replicable models enable any organization to adopt the approach. When we develop embeddable calculators for six news outlets, any outlet can use them. When we create training materials, any organization can access them. The infrastructure benefits the entire field.\n\nHow This Advances Economic Mobility:\n\nGeographic inequality in analysis capacity creates information asymmetry. When only well-resourced national organizations can analyze policy impacts, communities lack tools to advocate for their interests or hold policymakers accountable. By systematically supporting local organizations to use sophisticated infrastructure, we enable evidence-based participation in policy debates at the community level.\n\nLocal journalists can report on how policies affect their readers specifically. State policy organizations can analyze district-level impacts. Community organizations serving people experiencing economic insecurity can identify which policy changes help their clients. This democratized access to analysis infrastructure advances economic mobility by enabling communities to advocate effectively for policies that work.\n\nBudget ($200,000):\nPersonnel ($110,000): 1 FTE Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator\nTraining delivery and curriculum development\nOngoing technical assistance and relationship management\nDocumentation and replication materials\nPartnership recruitment and coordination\nPartnership Mini-Grants ($60,000):\n6 journalism partnerships \u00d7 $6,000 = $36,000\n4-5 policy organizations \u00d7 $4,000 = $18,000\n2-3 community organizations \u00d7 $3,000 = $6,000\nMini-grants enable partners to dedicate staff time to learning and using tools\nInfrastructure & Training ($30,000):\nEmbeddable calculator development and customization\nRegional workshops and training events\nTravel to partner communities\nDocumentation, case studies, and replication guides\nEvaluation and learning\n\nWhat Success Looks Like:\n\nAfter one year:\n6 local news outlets regularly using PolicyEngine tools in policy coverage, with embeddable calculators deployed\n4-5 regional policy organizations conducting independent analysis using state legislative district data\n2-3 community organizations using PolicyEngine infrastructure to inform their work with clients\nOpen-source documentation enabling any organization to replicate the model\nCase studies demonstrating impact on local policy debates\nProven coordinator role that can be sustained through diverse funding\n\nThis isn't a pilot testing whether something works. It's systematizing and sustaining something that NEO's prior flexible support proved works. We're asking for continued support to build the capacity that makes our infrastructure accessible to the organizations serving communities NEO prioritizes.",
