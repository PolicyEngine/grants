Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group must independently build and maintain document libraries\u2014duplicating effort while links break and documents vanish. As the leading open-source rules engine powering tools helping over 100,000 Americans, PolicyEngine has seen how this foundational problem cripples the entire ecosystem. PolicyEngine Atlas solves this once, for everyone.\n\nBuilding on pilots with the Atlanta Fed, Atlas will be the first comprehensive, AI-powered archive of safety net policy documents. We'll retrieve, store, and continuously update thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals across 50 states\u2014preventing the link rot and document loss plaguing benefit delivery.\n\nAtlas goes beyond preservation. By integrating with PolicyEngine's proven rules engine, we transform static documents into a semantic knowledge graph revealing connections between programs and jurisdictions. This enables caseworkers to verify eligibility pathways with source documents, researchers to trace policy evolution, and AI tools to access authoritative sources through our web app, API, and MCP server.\n\nTo reduce administrative burden, we'll introduce the Clarity Index\u2014a scoring system that combines human expertise with AI to analyze Atlas's archived documents and identify which policy language causes errors and delays. Strategic subgrants to government-connected organizations help agencies learn from successful peers, transforming insights into clearer policy communication.\n\nPolicyEngine Atlas creates essential infrastructure for safety net transformation. By providing universal access to clear, computable, authoritative policy documents, we enable the entire ecosystem\u2014from applicants to policymakers\u2014to make our fragmented benefit system work as one.",

Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group works with fragments of the policy landscape\u2014unable to see connections across programs or jurisdictions. When Casetext shut down, thousands of legal aid organizations lost document access overnight. This fragmentation forces each organization to solve the same problem separately, wasting resources.\n\nRules-as-code developers cannot establish authoritative sources for their calculations. While PolicyEngine cites over 2,500 policy URLs, these remain disconnected fragments rather than a semantic system. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator lack direct access to regulatory text behind eligibility determinations\u2014verification requires digging through code rather than referencing documentation. Without a platform connecting computable policies to authoritative documents, tools cannot earn government trust.\n\nThe fragmentation also hides critical eligibility pathways. Categorical eligibility chains exist across programs\u2014TANF enables SNAP, SNAP qualifies for Lifeline, LIHEAP unlocks weatherization\u2014but remain invisible in traditional document search. Caseworkers cannot discover these connections systematically, meaning families miss benefits they qualify for because policies aren't computationally linked.\n\nMeanwhile, unclear policy language drives administrative burden costing billions annually. GAO calls complex regulations \"inherently error-prone,\" creating barriers preventing eligible families from accessing benefits. Yet agencies cannot learn which language patterns work because no infrastructure enables comparison across jurisdictions. States repeat mistakes; improvement remains guesswork.\n\nAs AI tools increasingly assist with benefit navigation, the lack of authoritative sources becomes critical.

Benefit Navigator integrates Atlas into their Information Hub serving caseworkers across LA County, Riverside, Alameda, DC, Chicago, and New York, demonstrating rules-as-code value through their Riverside County Agentic AI pilot with Nava Labs.\n\nOur bounty program incentivizes experts from trusted organizations like Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit their own documents. Government partners like the Atlanta Federal Reserve integrate our system into their Policy Rules Database. Community advocates contribute through our open GitHub process, ensuring affected populations have direct input.\n\nContinuous feedback loops ensure we remain responsive to user needs. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator provide monthly reports on Atlas integration, error rates, and user feedback. Academic partners share research findings. Government contacts communicate policy changes. This multi-stakeholder approach ensures Atlas serves everyone from individual caseworkers to federal agencies, creating lasting infrastructure for equitable benefit access.",

        "plainText": "PolicyEngine Atlas builds on our existing Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, extending proven systems that already serve over 100,000 Americans through our rules engine. GCP provides auto-scaling compute for AI crawlers, Cloud Storage for documents, and managed services reducing operational complexity. Git repositories store documents with version history while GitHub Actions automate testing and deployment.\n\nWe're developing Atlas as a public good, accessible by any institution\u2014government or otherwise\u2014through open APIs and source code. Rather than requiring government systems to integrate with us, we provide multiple access methods: REST API for programmatic access, MCP server for AI assistants, web interface for caseworkers, and raw GitHub repositories for transparency. This flexibility lets agencies adopt Atlas at their own pace using their preferred integration approach.\n\nOur outreach focuses on understanding government document management needs. Through partnerships with MyFriendBen's Colorado agency connections and Benefit Navigator's government relationships, we learn how agencies currently manage policy documents and what barriers prevent clearer communication. These insights shape Atlas development, ensuring our open source solution meets real government needs.\n\nThe integration with PolicyEngine's encoded rules creates unique value for government. When agencies see their documents connected to actual calculations affecting constituents, they understand how unclear language creates errors. Our semantic layer reveals how their policies interact with other programs, surfacing categorical eligibility pathways they may not realize exist. This combination of document management and rules-as-code demonstrates to agencies how modern infrastructure can reduce administrative burden while improving accuracy for the families they serve.",

We offer a free web app and Python package, charge $0.02 per household API request (near cost), and provide Docker images for self-hosting at no charge. This approach established us as the standard open source rules API, generating revenue through feature enhancements (encoding new policies), enterprise support, research projects, and subgrants.\n\nAtlas follows this proven model. By 2027, operational costs will be minimal\u2014primarily cloud storage and occasional document updates. Revenue streams mirror our successful formula: enterprise support for organizations needing guaranteed uptime, contracts to add new program types or jurisdictions, custom metadata integration with specific rules engines, and government contracts for onsite installations supporting clearer policy document assembly and dissemination.\n\nOur mission drives accessibility-first pricing. Basic Atlas access remains free forever, ensuring small nonprofits can benefit. We charge only for premium features that large organizations value: guaranteed response times, custom integrations, priority support. Government agencies will increasingly seek our expertise to modernize their document management workflows, creating sustainable revenue while improving public services.\n\nTechnical efficiency ensures long-term viability. AI training costs decrease as models learn patterns. Community contributions through bounties reduce acquisition costs. Automated monitoring minimizes manual oversight. GitHub's infrastructure handles storage and versioning at minimal cost for 5,000 documents.\n\nThis sustainability model\u2014proven through PolicyEngine's growth to serving over 100,000 Americans\u2014ensures Atlas becomes permanent infrastructure.

Infrastructure costs of $81,200 cover cloud computing, AI APIs, technical advisory services, search infrastructure, and document verification bounties. Travel and conferences add $5,132, with 15% indirect costs of $95,075.\n\nPolicyEngine's funding trajectory shows strong growth. From our current $1 million budget in 2025, we project reaching $1.68 million in 2026 (68% growth) through confirmed grants: NSF ($200k of $300k total), MyFriendBen ($100k), and Arnold Ventures ($180k of $270k total). By 2027, we project $1.93 million through continued organic growth. This diversification includes NSF grants, Arnold Ventures support, NEO Philanthropy, subgrants from MyFriendBen, Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity, and contracts with Benefit Navigator.\n\nFinancial controls ensure responsible stewardship.

        "plainText": "Purpose:\n\nThis project expands PolicyEngine's analytical capabilities to comprehensively model family economic security policies affecting prenatal-to-age-3 children across all 50 states. The expansion focuses on three core deliverables:\nChild Poverty Impact Dashboard - A specialized analytical interface enabling users to model and compare policy reforms including:\nChild Tax Credit (CTC) variations by amount, age eligibility (prenatal-3, 0-5, 0-17), income basis, and phaseout structure\nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC) reforms including individualization and expansion options\nDependent exemptions, universal basic income, and SNAP modifications\nState-specific policy levers and new state-level CTCs\nResults displaying fiscal costs, child poverty impacts (overall and ages 0-3), and distributional effects\nComprehensive State Program Modeling - Full implementation of TANF and Child Care and Development Fund eligibility and benefit calculation rules for all 50 states, enabling complete nationwide policy analysis with programmatic representation of each state's unique rules.\nTraining and Expert Consultation - Webinars, training sessions, and analytical support for national PN-3 partners and state leaders, with participation from leaders in at least 30 states.\n\nIntended Impact:\n\nThe project will transform how stakeholders analyze policies affecting young children and families by:\n\nDemocratizing Policy Analysis:\nCurrently, sophisticated microsimulation modeling is accessible primarily to well-resourced research institutions. PolicyEngine makes this capability freely available to advocacy organizations, state agencies, and community groups, leveling the information playing field for policy debates.\n\nEnabling State-Level Action:\nWith all 50 states modeled, state legislators and governors can analyze how federal policy changes would affect their specific state, and design complementary state-level interventions optimized for their populations.\n\nAccelerating Evidence-Based Policymaking:\nInstead of waiting months for commissioned analysis, policymakers can instantly model policy alternatives, understanding trade-offs between different design choices (e.g., age targeting vs. universal benefits, refundability structures, interaction effects with existing programs).\n\nSupporting Cross-State Learning:\nBy providing comparable analysis across all states, the project enables movement actors to identify successful state innovations and build support for scaling effective policies.\n\nMeasurable Outcomes:\nDashboard operational by April 2026 with prenatal-to-age-3 modeling capabilities\nAll 50 states' TANF and CCDF rules implemented by October 2026\nLeaders from 30+ states trained on PolicyEngine tools by October 2026\nNational PN-3 partners (Niskanen Center, PN-3 Policy Impact Center) using PolicyEngine for analysis and advocacy\n\nThrough these capabilities, the project enables the movement building necessary to achieve universal access to PN-3 supports and resources by 2027.",

AI-assisted: 10-15 hours per program.\n\nTechnical approach: Off-the-shelf LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) with prompts validated against PolicyEngine's 1,000+ merged pull requests\u2014human-reviewed code showing how experts translate policy to calculations. We're already using Claude Code agents to encode new TANF programs with specialized skills and slash commands.\n\nThis enables keeping pace with policy updates (hundreds annually across 50 states), capturing edge cases, and responding to partner needs within days instead of months.\nStochastic Imputation for Incomplete User Data\n\nMachine learning models predict missing household characteristics when benefit navigators have partial information. Instead of requiring 50 questions, calculate benefit ranges from 30 questions by imputing likely values for missing data.\n\nFoundation already built: PolicyEngine's enhanced microdata uses quantile regression forests for income imputation (production code serving 100K+ users). This extends that validated approach to assets, expenses, family composition.\n\nTechnical: Train gradient boosting models on 300,000+ households. Predict distributions with confidence intervals. When Starlight knows income but not assets, we calculate \"likely $1,200-2,400 in benefits (80% confidence).\"\n\nImpact: Reduced data collection should improve completion rates.\nNatural Language Explanation Layer\n\nLLMs translate PolicyEngine calculations into plain language. When API returns \"$3,200 SNAP,\" AI explains why and what if: \"With your household size and income, you qualify for maximum SNAP. This phases out as income increases\u2014working 10 more hours weekly could reduce benefits by $120/month.\"\n\nPartners need this: MyFriendBen wants to show not just \"you qualify\" but WHY. Our API currently returns numbers; partners write explanations manually.\n\nIntegration & OpenAI Support:\n\nThese form an integrated pipeline: Documents \u2192 Rules \u2192 Code \u2192 Calculations with partial data \u2192 Plain language explanations.\n\nOpenAI technical advisors will help optimize prompts for complex policy language, prevent hallucinations in code generation, and ensure explanation quality. API credits enable processing thousands of policy documents and generating millions of explanations for end-users through partners.\n\nInfrastructure Leverage:\n\nMost AI benefit projects focus on consumer interfaces. We're automating infrastructure that multiple tools depend on. When we improve PolicyEngine, it helps MyFriendBen's 50K users, Amplifi's platform, Starlight's credit unions, and Student Basic Needs Coalition's campuses simultaneously.",

        "plainText": "Development Progress (Where We Are Now):\n\nPolicyEngine isn't starting from zero\u2014we're already using AI extensively in production. We integrated GPT-4 into our web app within a month of its release in 2023 for generating policy analysis from microsimulation results; today we use Claude for these features, demonstrating our ability to adopt and deploy cutting-edge AI rapidly as it emerges. We've deployed Claude Code multi-agent workflows for policy research automation (documented in our recent blog post), where specialized agents handle data fetching, Python script writing, and report generation. We've built the policyengine-claude plugin providing Claude Code users with PolicyEngine-specific skills and agents. These aren't experiments\u2014they're production features serving users.\n\nFor rules encoding specifically, we're using Claude Code agents with specialized skills and slash commands to encode new TANF programs. Early validation shows AI can draft accurate code when prompted with examples from our 1,000+ merged pull requests\u2014human-reviewed, production-tested code serving as the gold standard for how expert developers translate policy language into executable calculations.\n\nOur enhanced microdata, which uses quantile regression forests for income imputation, is production code serving over 100,000 API users. Stochastic imputation will extend this validated ML infrastructure to full household profiles. We've also built an MCP server demonstrating effective LLM integration and collected 2,500+ policy document citations that serve as training data for rule extraction.\n\nPartner validation confirms demand: MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, and Student Basic Needs Coalition use our API in production and have confirmed that faster policy updates and stochastic imputation are critical infrastructure needs. Our Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, API systems, and CI/CD pipelines are all operational, meaning we're adding AI to existing, proven systems rather than building from scratch. We estimate we're 30% complete on technical groundwork\u2014this isn't theoretical research, it's scaling experiments that are working.\n\nSix-Month Demonstration:\n\nMilestone 1 (Months 1-2): Integrated Rule Extraction & Code Generation\n\nWe'll build an end-to-end AI pipeline that takes policy documents and produces validated PolicyEngine code. Our target improvements focus on fine-grained eligibility details for existing programs (income phase-out calculations, asset test nuances, categorical eligibility chains), rapid updates when policies change (like SNAP emergency allotments or state EITC adjustments), and missing state variations in federal programs.\n\nThe AI approach uses off-the-shelf LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) with carefully designed prompts validated against PolicyEngine's 1,000+ merged pull requests. We'll develop structured extraction prompts for eligibility criteria and benefit formulas, generate Python code following proven patterns from our production codebase, and leverage our existing Claude Code agent experiments with TANF encoding. All AI-generated code goes through human review before deployment to ensure accuracy and maintainability.\n\nWe'll measure success through encoding time reduction (targeting 50% or more), accuracy compared to expert review (targeting 90% or higher), and partner adoption rates. The deliverable is 10 new programs or major improvements encoded using AI assistance, with published metrics comparing AI-assisted development to traditional manual encoding.\n\nMilestone 2 (Months 2-4): Stochastic Imputation Extension\n\nBuilding on PolicyEngine's existing ML imputation capabilities (which currently handle income only), we'll extend the system to predict full household profiles including assets, childcare expenses, medical costs, and family composition. This uses the same proven quantile regression forest foundation that already works in production, training gradient boosting models on 300,000+ households in our enhanced microdata to predict distributions for missing inputs and generate benefit range estimates with confidence intervals.\n\nThe practical impact is significant: instead of requiring users to answer 50 questions to get benefit estimates, navigators can provide useful ranges with only 30 questions answered. This stochastic API will launch with Starlight and MyFriendBen, validated to ensure 80% or more of actual household values fall within our predicted ranges. User testing will measure whether reduced data collection improves completion rates as partners anticipate.\n\nMilestone 3 (Months 4-6): Explanation Layer & Full Integration\n\nThe final milestone deploys our LLM explanation system and integrates all three AI components with partners to measure end-to-end impact. The explanation layer generates plain-language descriptions from calculation traces, including policy citations, scenario comparisons, and confidence levels, with partner testing ensuring the AI-generated explanations are actually comprehensible to real users.\n\nWith the full pipeline operational\u2014documents flowing to extracted rules to generated code to stochastic calculations to plain-language explanations\u2014we'll monitor accuracy, processing speed, partner adoption patterns, and downstream benefits accessed by end users. The complete AI stack will be deployed with MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, and Student Basic Needs Coalition, giving us real-world validation across different use cases and user populations.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\nTechnical: 20-30 new benefit programs or major improvements versus 5-10 baseline, representing 50-75% reduction in encoding time per program. Stochastic API enabling benefit estimates with less required user data. Partner adoption within 2 weeks of encoding rather than 2-3 months typical for manual integration.\n\nPartner impact: MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, and Student Basic Needs Coalition will measure how AI-enabled improvements affect their users. We'll track: completion rates with reduced data collection, user engagement with newly encoded programs, and benefits accessed through faster coverage expansion.\n\nDeliverables: Fully open-source AI prompts and frameworks, ML models and training code, comprehensive evaluation report documenting what worked and how other civic tech organizations can replicate AI-accelerated rules-as-code development.",

Pavel built PolicyEngine's enhanced microdata using quantile regression forests and gradient boosting, achieving 40% improved income imputation accuracy in production systems serving 100,000+ API users. Ben developed our microdata calibration systems and brings expertise in survey weighting and statistical modeling. Together they will lead stochastic imputation development, extending these proven techniques to predict full household profiles and fill data gaps when users provide incomplete information.\n\nNikhil Woodruff (Co-founder and CTO) architected PolicyEngine's API infrastructure and has experience integrating AI/ML systems into production environments. He'll lead the code generation AI and overall system architecture, ensuring AI components integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure handling millions of calculations monthly.\n\nMax Ghenis (Co-founder and CEO), a former Google data scientist, brings expertise in microsimulation modeling and policy analysis. He's led development of PolicyEngine's production AI features: integrated GPT-4 within a month of its 2023 release (now using Claude for policy analysis generation), built Claude Code multi-agent workflows for research automation (documented in published blog posts), and created the policyengine-claude Claude Code plugin. This track record shows rapid AI adoption and deployment capability\u2014we ship new AI features within weeks of model releases.\n\nOur domain expertise comes from three years encoding 1,000+ benefit and tax variables manually. This hands-on experience with policy language, edge cases, and validation requirements is crucial for training AI systems and validating outputs. We understand where policies are ambiguous, which rules interact, and what edge cases matter\u2014knowledge that makes the difference between AI that helps and AI that misleads.\n\nWe have production AI systems deployed: LLM integration for policy analysis generation (GPT-4 within a month of its 2023 release, now Claude\u2014showing we adopt cutting-edge AI rapidly), Claude Code multi-agent workflows automating routine policy research (distributional analysis, poverty calculations, inequality metrics), and the policyengine-claude Claude Code plugin providing PolicyEngine-specific skills and agents. For rules encoding specifically, Claude Code agents draft accurate code when prompted with examples from our 1,000+ merged pull requests\u2014human-reviewed, production-tested code that represents the gold standard.\n\nOpenAI technical advisors will be critical for optimizing LLM prompts, handling structured extraction from complex policy documents, preventing hallucinations in code generation, and ensuring explanation quality. Their guidance will accelerate development and help us navigate challenges like ambiguous policy language, conflicting source documents, and edge case handling.\n\nPartner validation comes from MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, and Student Basic Needs Coalition, who use our API in production and will provide real-world testing, user feedback, and validation of AI-generated outputs. Their frontline experience ensures our AI improvements meet actual user needs rather than theoretical benchmarks.\n\nOur infrastructure foundation enables rapid AI integration: Google Cloud Platform, CI/CD pipelines, API systems, and open-source repositories with active community contributions. We're not building from scratch\u2014we're adding AI to proven, operational systems.\n\nTeam capacity: 3.5 FTE dedicated to this project (Pavel and Ben full-time on ML, Nikhil 0.75 FTE on infrastructure, Max 0.75 FTE on partnerships and validation). This focused capacity is sufficient for 6-month delivery without additional hiring, which is critical for meeting the timeline.\n\nOur track record demonstrates delivery capability: we built PolicyEngine from zero to 100,000 users in three years, shipping new features multiple times weekly. We've proven we can build complex systems, maintain production quality, and respond rapidly to partner needs. This AI project extends that track record into automation and acceleration.",

        "plainText": "Who: Stakeholder Definition\n\nPrimary stakeholders: Low-income individuals and families accessing benefits through navigation tools\u2014people earning below living wage, experiencing economic insecurity, navigating SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, childcare subsidies, energy assistance, and other safety net programs.\n\nDemographics: Predominantly women (primary caregivers, single parents), communities of color disproportionately reliant on safety net programs, immigrants accessing programs without citizenship requirements, people with disabilities navigating complex eligibility rules, working families facing benefit cliffs.\n\nIntermediaries: Benefit navigation tools (MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition) serving these populations. Case workers, community organizations, legal aid providers.\n\nHow Many: Scale and Reach\n\nSix-month pilot: Infrastructure serving 100,000+ existing users across PolicyEngine API partners (MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition).\n\nYear 2: Expanded coverage enables partners to reach 250,000-500,000 users as faster encoding unlocks previously inaccessible programs.\n\nLong-term potential: PolicyEngine API is open-source infrastructure. Anyone building benefit navigation tools can use it. As coverage expands through AI acceleration, potential reach is millions\u2014every benefit navigator in the U.S. can leverage faster, more comprehensive rules-as-code.\n\nWhat Impact: Specific Outcomes and Scale\n\nThe Infrastructure Leverage Argument:\n\nGitLab could fund 10 individual benefit navigators to expand their coverage. Alternatively, funding calculation infrastructure that multiple navigators depend on creates different leverage. PolicyEngine powers MyFriendBen (50K users), Amplifi's benefit navigation platform, Starlight (credit union partnerships), Student Basic Needs Coalition (college students), and others. When infrastructure improves, the benefits multiply across the entire ecosystem.\n\nWhen we add fine-grained eligibility calculations, every navigator offers more accurate estimates. When stochastic imputation reduces data collection, every tool's completion rate improves. Infrastructure investment has multiplicative impact\u2014one improvement helps hundreds of thousands across multiple platforms.\n\nPolicyEngine is infrastructure, but infrastructure with massive leverage:\n\nDirect infrastructure improvements:\nEncoding speed: 5-10\u00d7 faster program coverage (from 40-80 hours to 10-15 hours per program)\nCoverage expansion: 20-30 new benefit programs in 6 months (vs. 5-10 baseline)\nAPI performance: Latency reduction through ML prediction caching\nAccessibility: Benefit range estimates with less required user data (enabling more people to get estimates)\n\nDownstream economic impact through partners:\n\nMyFriendBen currently serves 50,000+ users. They're constrained by PolicyEngine coverage\u2014when we don't have a program encoded, they can't help users access it. Faster AI encoding directly removes this constraint.\n\nStarlight partners with credit unions serving low-income members. Their benefit prediction depends on PolicyEngine calculations. Stochastic imputation enables them to provide estimates when members have incomplete financial data, expanding their reach.\n\nStudent Basic Needs Coalition uses PolicyEngine for SNAP calculations serving college students. Faster encoding of state-specific variations helps them serve more campuses.\n\nImpact Through Partners:\n\nPolicyEngine is infrastructure\u2014we measure impact through what partners achieve with improved capabilities:\n\nTechnical improvements: AI-accelerated encoding (targeting 20-30 programs vs. 5-10 baseline), 50-75% reduction in encoding time per program, stochastic imputation enabling benefit estimates with less user data.\n\nPartner adoption: When we add programs or capabilities, partners integrate them. MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, and Student Basic Needs Coalition will measure user engagement with AI-enabled features, completion rates with stochastic imputation, and benefits accessed through newly encoded programs.\n\nWe'll measure and report: encoding speed improvements, programs added, partner integration speed, partner-reported user metrics. Since we're infrastructure, the economic impact depends on how partners deploy improvements to end users.\n\nMeasurement:\n\nPartner metrics: Track user growth in AI-enabled programs, engagement rates, reported benefits accessed.\n\nInfrastructure metrics: Programs encoded per month, encoding time reduction, API latency, accuracy vs. human expert validation.\n\nEconomic metrics: Partner-reported $ in benefits accessed through newly encoded programs, estimated wage preservation from workforce-enabling programs (childcare, TANF).\n\nPublication: Open evaluation report documenting encoding speed improvements, partner adoption, estimated downstream economic impact, challenges encountered, and replication guide for other civic tech infrastructure providers.\n\nChange to Existing Program:\n\nPolicyEngine currently serves 100,000+ users through partner tools. Manual encoding limits how fast we expand coverage. This project transforms that speed: targeting 20-30 programs in 6 months instead of 5-10 baseline. When partners need fine-grained eligibility details (categorical eligibility chains, asset test exceptions, state-specific phase-out calculations), manual encoding takes weeks. With AI assistance: days.\n\nFaster encoding means partners can respond to user needs more rapidly. The efficiency improvement compounds: faster encoding enables partners to expand coverage, more users access benefits, more data validates our models, AI improves, encoding gets even faster. This cycle could transform benefit navigation from program-by-program development to systematic coverage.\n\nWhy Infrastructure:\n\nPolicyEngine powers MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, and other benefit navigation tools. When we improve calculation infrastructure, all partners benefit simultaneously. Each improvement multiplies across the ecosystem. Infrastructure investment has different leverage than funding individual navigators.",

        "plainText": "PolicyEngine's mission is to compute the impact of public policy for the world. We build free, open-source microsimulation models that enable anyone\u2014policymakers, researchers, journalists, advocates, and the public\u2014to rigorously analyze how tax and benefit policies affect households and society.\n\nWe work toward a future where evidence-based policy analysis is not a privilege of well-resourced national organizations, but public infrastructure accessible to every community. Today, sophisticated microsimulation capacity concentrates in Washington DC and New York. Smaller metros, rural areas, and regions outside these major centers lack the infrastructure to independently analyze how policies affect their communities. This creates geographic inequality in policy knowledge\u2014some places can participate in informed debates about economic mobility policies while others cannot.\n\nOur vision is a world where a state legislator in Alabama can model how a state tax credit affects her district, where a journalist in rural Montana can analyze federal benefit changes for her readers, where a community organization in any city can understand policy impacts on the families they serve, and where benefit navigation tools can provide accurate, real-time information to people seeking support.\n\nPolicyEngine provides infrastructure used by over 100,000 people annually\u2014both policy analysts and individuals experiencing economic insecurity. Organizations serving people with lived experience depend on our calculations: MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help people identify benefits they qualify for; Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP eligibility calculations to support college students facing food insecurity. Simultaneously, policy organizations like Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our tools for analysis. Our work is strictly nonpartisan\u2014we provide neutral infrastructure that any individual or organization can use to analyze any tax or benefit proposal according to their own values and priorities.",

Our platform models federal and state programs including income taxes, the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and other programs across all 50 states.\n\nWhat we do:\n\nWe provide computational infrastructure serving organizations helping people navigate benefit systems and researchers analyzing policy impacts. Our API powers benefit access tools used by individuals experiencing economic insecurity: MyFriendBen for benefit eligibility screening, Amplifi's Benefit Navigator for accurate benefit information, and Student Basic Needs Coalition's SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity.\n\nOn the policy side, our infrastructure serves users from congressional offices to community organizations. Staff at the Joint Economic Committee, congressional offices, New York State Senate, and DC Council use our tools\u2014in some cases citing our research when proposing policies like state child tax credits. State-level organizations like Colorado Fiscal Institute and national policy organizations including Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our infrastructure, as do community organizations like Mother's Outreach Network.\n\nNEO's impact on our sustainability:\n\nThanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we built the flexible partnership capacity that now sustains our work. That funding enabled us to engage organizations lacking microsimulation access\u2014including partnerships with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center. These relationships directly resulted in Pritzker Children's Initiative supporting our child poverty analysis work. This demonstrates how flexible general operating support enables relationship-building essential for long-term sustainability.\n\nWhile Arnold Ventures supports our congressional district-level data capability and the National Science Foundation expands our open-source ecosystem, these investments provide technical infrastructure. This NEO grant would sustain the partnership capacity that enables organizations to actually use that infrastructure.\n\nHow our work leads to impact:\n\nWe make sophisticated analysis accessible to those previously lacking capacity\u2014benefit navigation tools, local journalists, state policy organizations, community groups. This democratized access enables communities to participate in policy debates with evidence, leading to policies that more effectively address economic mobility.\n\nHow we define success:\n\nSuccess means MyFriendBen can reliably help someone identify benefits, a small-town newspaper can analyze policy impacts, and a state legislator can understand constituent effects\u2014all using the same rigorous foundation. We measure reach, sustainability of partner capacity, influence on decisions advancing economic mobility, and infrastructure quality.",

        "plainText": "Quantitative analysis tells only part of the story. Our role is providing infrastructure that communities can use according to their priorities. This shapes how we address each research principle:\n\nIntersectional approach reflecting lived experience:\n\nOur microsimulation models calculate policy impacts across income, household composition, geography, age, employment, gender, race, and ethnicity. However, numbers alone cannot capture intersectional experience. This is why partnerships with organizations serving people with lived experience are essential. MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help individuals identify benefits\u2014tools for people navigating complex systems, often in crisis. PolicyEngine's leadership also has direct family experience navigating Section 8, Medicaid, and disability services, informing our commitment to accurate infrastructure. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity. Our journalism partnerships add qualitative understanding of what impacts mean for safety, dignity, and belonging.\n\nHonoring distinct worldviews:\n\nPolicyEngine provides neutral infrastructure that communities across the political spectrum use according to their own values and priorities. Conservative think tanks analyzing work incentives, progressive groups examining poverty reduction, and nonpartisan journalists all use the same rigorous foundation but interpret findings through their distinct worldviews. This pluralistic approach honors diverse ways of understanding policy impacts.\n\nDemonstrated partnership with historically marginalized communities:\n\nOur role is building infrastructure that communities can use according to their priorities. Geographic inequality in analysis capacity disproportionately affects regions with historically marginalized populations. This grant would enable partnerships focused on the American South, smaller metros, and rural areas\u2014places currently lacking sophisticated policy analysis infrastructure. Thanks to NEO's previous support, we successfully engaged organizations that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling. This grant would systematize that approach with dedicated staff providing training, technical support, and tools that remain accessible to communities after the grant period ends.\n\nExpansive understanding beyond financial outcomes:\n\nPolicyEngine calculates financial impacts\u2014poverty rates, income changes, benefit receipt. But economic mobility encompasses dignity, agency, belonging, and autonomy\u2014dimensions microsimulation cannot quantify. Our journalism partnerships address this gap. When a local reporter uses our congressional district data showing 1,200 children lifted from poverty, then interviews families about what stable childcare means for their lives, the combination captures both financial and human dimensions.\n\nInnovative uses of qualitative data:\n\nThis project systematizes partnerships pairing hyperlocal microsimulation with community storytelling. Arnold Ventures funded our congressional district and state-level capability. This grant would expand to state legislative districts and metro areas for analyzing federal and state policies at unprecedented local scales. By partnering with local journalists, we create space for ethnographic reporting. A Birmingham journalist asks \"how would this policy affect families in my city?\" then uses our tools to tell their stories. The research question originates in the community; PolicyEngine provides infrastructure.\n\nOur commitment:\n\nThis grant enables systematic support\u2014dedicated staff time for training, relationship-building, and sustained partnership with community-rooted organizations. We commit to moving at the speed of trust, listening to partner needs, and respecting diverse organizational capacities.",

        "plainText": "What we're asking to sustain:\n\nPolicyEngine provides infrastructure that organizations serving people with lived experience depend on: MyFriendBen for benefit eligibility, Amplifi's Benefit Navigator for accurate calculations, Student Basic Needs Coalition for SNAP eligibility. Arnold Ventures funded our congressional district and state-level analysis capability. This grant would expand geographic granularity to state legislative districts and metro areas while building sustained capacity to support organizations using this infrastructure.\n\nThanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we responded to partnership needs as they emerged\u2014working with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, leading to Pritzker Children's Initiative funding for child poverty work. We experimented with journalism partnerships and trained organizations without traditional modeling resources. This grant would systematize that successful model, building permanent capacity instead of ad-hoc partnerships.\n\nThe capacity we need to build:\n\nWithout dedicated staff, infrastructure goes underutilized. Organizations need training, technical assistance, and relationship management to use sophisticated tools. This grant would fund one full-time Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator providing systematic support to 12-15 organizations:\n\nLocal journalism partnerships (6 outlets, $36k): Our primary focus. The coordinator trains journalists to use PolicyEngine tools directly, develops embeddable calculators enabling readers to see personal policy impacts, and provides technical assistance. Geographic priority: Southern states, smaller metros, rural areas where journalism is resource-constrained.\n\nRegional policy organizations (4-5 partners, $18k): State-level think tanks and policy coalitions across the political spectrum needing training to use state legislative district data.\n\nCommunity organizations (2-3 partners, $6k): Direct service providers understanding benefit cliffs from daily work but lacking tools to model alternatives.\n\nWhy this builds sustainable capacity:\n\nThis creates three forms of sustainability: (1) Organizational\u2014permanent staff capacity for partnership support, not temporary projects. (2) Partner\u2014organizations learn to use infrastructure independently; skills persist after the grant ends. (3) Field\u2014open-source documentation enables any organization to adopt the approach.\n\nGeographic inequality in analysis capacity creates information asymmetry. When only well-resourced national organizations can analyze policy impacts, communities lack tools to advocate effectively. By systematically supporting local organizations, we enable evidence-based participation in policy debates. Local journalists report on reader impacts. State policy organizations analyze district-level effects. Community organizations identify which policies help their clients.\n\nBudget ($200,000): Personnel ($110,000): coordinator for training, technical assistance, relationship management. Partnership mini-grants ($60,000): 6 journalism \u00d7 $6,000, 4-5 policy orgs \u00d7 $4,000, 2-3 community orgs \u00d7 $3,000. Infrastructure ($30,000): embeddable calculators, workshops, travel, documentation.\n\nAfter one year: 6 news outlets using PolicyEngine tools with embeddable calculators deployed, 4-5 policy organizations conducting independent analysis, 2-3 community organizations using infrastructure to inform client work, open-source documentation enabling replication, proven coordinator role sustainable through diverse funding. This systematizes what NEO's prior support proved works.",
