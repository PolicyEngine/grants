Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group must independently build and maintain document libraries\u2014duplicating effort while links break and documents vanish. As the leading open-source rules engine powering tools helping over 100,000 Americans, PolicyEngine has seen how this foundational problem cripples the entire ecosystem. PolicyEngine Atlas solves this once, for everyone.\n\nBuilding on pilots with the Atlanta Fed, Atlas will be the first comprehensive, AI-powered archive of safety net policy documents. We'll retrieve, store, and continuously update thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals across 50 states\u2014preventing the link rot and document loss plaguing benefit delivery.\n\nAtlas goes beyond preservation. By integrating with PolicyEngine's proven rules engine, we transform static documents into a semantic knowledge graph revealing connections between programs and jurisdictions. This enables caseworkers to verify eligibility pathways with source documents, researchers to trace policy evolution, and AI tools to access authoritative sources through our web app, API, and MCP server.\n\nTo reduce administrative burden, we'll introduce the Clarity Index\u2014a scoring system that combines human expertise with AI to analyze Atlas's archived documents and identify which policy language causes errors and delays. Strategic subgrants to government-connected organizations help agencies learn from successful peers, transforming insights into clearer policy communication.\n\nPolicyEngine Atlas creates essential infrastructure for safety net transformation. By providing universal access to clear, computable, authoritative policy documents, we enable the entire ecosystem\u2014from applicants to policymakers\u2014to make our fragmented benefit system work as one.",

Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group works with fragments of the policy landscape\u2014unable to see connections across programs or jurisdictions. When Casetext shut down, thousands of legal aid organizations lost document access overnight. This fragmentation forces each organization to solve the same problem separately, wasting resources.\n\nRules-as-code developers cannot establish authoritative sources for their calculations. While PolicyEngine cites over 2,500 policy URLs, these remain disconnected fragments rather than a semantic system. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator lack direct access to regulatory text behind eligibility determinations\u2014verification requires digging through code rather than referencing documentation. Without a platform connecting computable policies to authoritative documents, tools cannot earn government trust.\n\nThe fragmentation also hides critical eligibility pathways. Categorical eligibility chains exist across programs\u2014TANF enables SNAP, SNAP qualifies for Lifeline, LIHEAP unlocks weatherization\u2014but remain invisible in traditional document search. Caseworkers cannot discover these connections systematically, meaning families miss benefits they qualify for because policies aren't computationally linked.\n\nMeanwhile, unclear policy language drives administrative burden costing billions annually. GAO calls complex regulations \"inherently error-prone,\" creating barriers preventing eligible families from accessing benefits. Yet agencies cannot learn which language patterns work because no infrastructure enables comparison across jurisdictions. States repeat mistakes; improvement remains guesswork.\n\nAs AI tools increasingly assist with benefit navigation, the lack of authoritative sources becomes critical.

Benefit Navigator integrates Atlas into their Information Hub serving caseworkers across LA County, Riverside, Alameda, DC, Chicago, and New York, demonstrating rules-as-code value through their Riverside County Agentic AI pilot with Nava Labs.\n\nOur bounty program incentivizes experts from trusted organizations like Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit their own documents. Government partners like the Atlanta Federal Reserve integrate our system into their Policy Rules Database. Community advocates contribute through our open GitHub process, ensuring affected populations have direct input.\n\nContinuous feedback loops ensure we remain responsive to user needs. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator provide monthly reports on Atlas integration, error rates, and user feedback. Academic partners share research findings. Government contacts communicate policy changes. This multi-stakeholder approach ensures Atlas serves everyone from individual caseworkers to federal agencies, creating lasting infrastructure for equitable benefit access.",

        "plainText": "PolicyEngine Atlas builds on our existing Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, extending proven systems that already serve over 100,000 Americans through our rules engine. GCP provides auto-scaling compute for AI crawlers, Cloud Storage for documents, and managed services reducing operational complexity. Git repositories store documents with version history while GitHub Actions automate testing and deployment.\n\nWe're developing Atlas as a public good, accessible by any institution\u2014government or otherwise\u2014through open APIs and source code. Rather than requiring government systems to integrate with us, we provide multiple access methods: REST API for programmatic access, MCP server for AI assistants, web interface for caseworkers, and raw GitHub repositories for transparency. This flexibility lets agencies adopt Atlas at their own pace using their preferred integration approach.\n\nOur outreach focuses on understanding government document management needs. Through partnerships with MyFriendBen's Colorado agency connections and Benefit Navigator's government relationships, we learn how agencies currently manage policy documents and what barriers prevent clearer communication. These insights shape Atlas development, ensuring our open source solution meets real government needs.\n\nThe integration with PolicyEngine's encoded rules creates unique value for government. When agencies see their documents connected to actual calculations affecting constituents, they understand how unclear language creates errors. Our semantic layer reveals how their policies interact with other programs, surfacing categorical eligibility pathways they may not realize exist. This combination of document management and rules-as-code demonstrates to agencies how modern infrastructure can reduce administrative burden while improving accuracy for the families they serve.",

We offer a free web app and Python package, charge $0.02 per household API request (near cost), and provide Docker images for self-hosting at no charge. This approach established us as the standard open source rules API, generating revenue through feature enhancements (encoding new policies), enterprise support, research projects, and subgrants.\n\nAtlas follows this proven model. By 2027, operational costs will be minimal\u2014primarily cloud storage and occasional document updates. Revenue streams mirror our successful formula: enterprise support for organizations needing guaranteed uptime, contracts to add new program types or jurisdictions, custom metadata integration with specific rules engines, and government contracts for onsite installations supporting clearer policy document assembly and dissemination.\n\nOur mission drives accessibility-first pricing. Basic Atlas access remains free forever, ensuring small nonprofits can benefit. We charge only for premium features that large organizations value: guaranteed response times, custom integrations, priority support. Government agencies will increasingly seek our expertise to modernize their document management workflows, creating sustainable revenue while improving public services.\n\nTechnical efficiency ensures long-term viability. AI training costs decrease as models learn patterns. Community contributions through bounties reduce acquisition costs. Automated monitoring minimizes manual oversight. GitHub's infrastructure handles storage and versioning at minimal cost for 5,000 documents.\n\nThis sustainability model\u2014proven through PolicyEngine's growth to serving over 100,000 Americans\u2014ensures Atlas becomes permanent infrastructure.

Infrastructure costs of $81,200 cover cloud computing, AI APIs, technical advisory services, search infrastructure, and document verification bounties. Travel and conferences add $5,132, with 15% indirect costs of $95,075.\n\nPolicyEngine's funding trajectory shows strong growth. From our current $1 million budget in 2025, we project reaching $1.68 million in 2026 (68% growth) through confirmed grants: NSF ($200k of $300k total), MyFriendBen ($100k), and Arnold Ventures ($180k of $270k total). By 2027, we project $1.93 million through continued organic growth. This diversification includes NSF grants, Arnold Ventures support, NEO Philanthropy, subgrants from MyFriendBen, Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity, and contracts with Benefit Navigator.\n\nFinancial controls ensure responsible stewardship.

        "plainText": "Purpose:\n\nThis project expands PolicyEngine's analytical capabilities to comprehensively model family economic security policies affecting prenatal-to-age-3 children across all 50 states. The expansion focuses on three core deliverables:\nChild Poverty Impact Dashboard - A specialized analytical interface enabling users to model and compare policy reforms including:\nChild Tax Credit (CTC) variations by amount, age eligibility (prenatal-3, 0-5, 0-17), income basis, and phaseout structure\nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC) reforms including individualization and expansion options\nDependent exemptions, universal basic income, and SNAP modifications\nState-specific policy levers and new state-level CTCs\nResults displaying fiscal costs, child poverty impacts (overall and ages 0-3), and distributional effects\nComprehensive State Program Modeling - Full implementation of TANF and Child Care and Development Fund eligibility and benefit calculation rules for all 50 states, enabling complete nationwide policy analysis with programmatic representation of each state's unique rules.\nTraining and Expert Consultation - Webinars, training sessions, and analytical support for national PN-3 partners and state leaders, with participation from leaders in at least 30 states.\n\nIntended Impact:\n\nThe project will transform how stakeholders analyze policies affecting young children and families by:\n\nDemocratizing Policy Analysis:\nCurrently, sophisticated microsimulation modeling is accessible primarily to well-resourced research institutions. PolicyEngine makes this capability freely available to advocacy organizations, state agencies, and community groups, leveling the information playing field for policy debates.\n\nEnabling State-Level Action:\nWith all 50 states modeled, state legislators and governors can analyze how federal policy changes would affect their specific state, and design complementary state-level interventions optimized for their populations.\n\nAccelerating Evidence-Based Policymaking:\nInstead of waiting months for commissioned analysis, policymakers can instantly model policy alternatives, understanding trade-offs between different design choices (e.g., age targeting vs. universal benefits, refundability structures, interaction effects with existing programs).\n\nSupporting Cross-State Learning:\nBy providing comparable analysis across all states, the project enables movement actors to identify successful state innovations and build support for scaling effective policies.\n\nMeasurable Outcomes:\nDashboard operational by April 2026 with prenatal-to-age-3 modeling capabilities\nAll 50 states' TANF and CCDF rules implemented by October 2026\nLeaders from 30+ states trained on PolicyEngine tools by October 2026\nNational PN-3 partners (Niskanen Center, PN-3 Policy Impact Center) using PolicyEngine for analysis and advocacy\n\nThrough these capabilities, the project enables the movement building necessary to achieve universal access to PN-3 supports and resources by 2027.",

Change detection algorithms monitor when policies update, triggering re-encoding workflows.\n\nWe have a working Atlas demo (will provide link). This grant scales it to systematic coverage.\nAI Code Generation with Rigorous Benchmarking\n\nLLMs extract benefit rules from Atlas documents and generate PolicyEngine Python code. The innovation is rigorous validation: we'll establish \"golden PR\" benchmarks where human experts encode programs as gold standard, then measure whether AI can match that quality.\n\nTarget programs for nationwide expansion: LIHEAP (currently only CO, CA, IL, NC, MA, TX), WIC state variations, Section 8 / housing choice vouchers, state rental assistance programs, potentially Medicaid LTSS. These exist in PolicyEngine for some states; AI will systematically expand coverage nationwide.\n\nProcess: LLM reads policy document \u2192 extracts eligibility rules \u2192 generates PolicyEngine code \u2192 runs through test suite \u2192 compared against human golden PR \u2192 fails/passes recorded \u2192 prompts adjusted \u2192 retry. Iterative improvement until AI code quality matches human expert baseline.\n\nTechnical: Off-the-shelf LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) with prompts validated against 1,000+ merged PolicyEngine PRs. We're already using Claude Code agents for TANF encoding with specialized skills\u2014this systematizes and measures that approach.\n\nValidation methodology: (1) Test suite pass rates, (2) AI-assisted code review comparing structure/readability, (3) Edge case coverage, (4) Documentation quality. All metrics published openly.\n\nWhy rigorous benchmarking matters: Shows what AI can actually do versus hype. Establishes which LLMs work best for policy encoding. Identifies where human review is essential. Creates replicable methodology for civic tech.\nLLM Benefit Estimation Evaluation (Research Component)\n\nGenerate thousands of test cases (household characteristics \u00d7 benefit programs \u00d7 edge cases) and measure: Can LLMs accurately estimate benefit eligibility and amounts?\n\nThree conditions tested:\nLLM alone (just the model)\nLLM + raw policy documents\nLLM + PolicyEngine API access (structured tool)\n\nMeasure accuracy against PolicyEngine ground truth. Identify failure modes: Do LLMs hallucinate eligibility? Miscalculate amounts? Miss edge cases? Invent rules that don't exist?\n\nThis demonstrates PolicyEngine's value proposition. When people ask \"why not just use ChatGPT for benefits?\" we'll have data: \"ChatGPT alone gets 40% wrong, with policy docs 25% wrong, with PolicyEngine API 5% wrong\" (example\u2014we'll measure actual numbers).\n\nTest case generation: Vary income ($0-100K), household size (1-8), composition (single/married, children/no children), employment, assets, expenses, disabilities. Cross with programs (SNAP, TANF, LIHEAP, WIC, Medicaid, housing). Generate edge cases (categorical eligibility, benefit cliffs, interaction effects).\n\nPublication: Results show which LLMs perform best, where they fail, and quantitative evidence for why benefit navigation needs structured tools like PolicyEngine rather than relying on LLM knowledge alone.\n\nIntegration & OpenAI Support:\n\nThese three components integrate: Atlas provides documents \u2192 Code generation creates rules \u2192 LLM evaluation validates that structured tools (PolicyEngine API) beat unstructured AI alone.\n\nOpenAI technical advisors will help: (1) Optimize prompts for policy language extraction, (2) Prevent hallucinations in code generation, (3) Design fair LLM evaluation methodology, (4) Ensure test cases cover diverse scenarios without contamination.\n\nAPI credits enable: Processing thousands of policy documents (Atlas), generating code for hundreds of variables, running thousands of LLM benefit estimation tests.\n\nOpen Source Multiplier:\n\nPolicyEngine is public infrastructure. Improvements don't just help current partners\u2014they're freely available as Python package and Docker image. Any nonprofit, government agency, or startup building benefit tools can use AI-accelerated PolicyEngine. The 2\u00a2/request hosted API makes it accessible even to small organizations. Published research and benchmarks help the entire civic tech field understand AI capabilities and limitations for benefit calculations.",

We're actively using Claude Code agents to encode TANF programs.\n\nAtlas foundation exists: we have a working demo of document retrieval and storage. Enhanced microdata uses ML (quantile regression forests) in production serving 100K+ API users. We have 1,000+ merged PRs as golden standard training data and 2,500+ policy citations.\n\nEstimate: 40% of infrastructure exists. Main development: systematizing AI code generation with rigorous quality measurement and conducting LLM evaluation research.\n\nSix-Month Plan:\n\nMilestone 1 (Months 1-2): Atlas Foundation + Initial Code Generation\n\nScale Atlas from demo to systematic policy document coverage for target programs: LIHEAP (50 states), WIC (state variations), Section 8/housing choice vouchers, state rental assistance, Medicaid LTSS. Implement continuous monitoring for document updates and archiving to prevent link rot.\n\nSimultaneously: Human experts encode 3 programs as \"golden PR\" benchmarks\u2014creating comprehensive test suites, documenting edge cases, establishing quality standards. These serve as ground truth for measuring AI code quality.\n\nAI Use: LLMs for document discovery and classification, embeddings for semantic search across jurisdictions, change detection when policies update.\n\nDeliverable: Atlas covering target program documents across 50 states. Three golden PR benchmarks with full test suites.\n\nMilestone 2 (Months 2-4): AI Code Generation with Iterative Quality Improvement\n\nLLMs extract rules from Atlas documents and generate PolicyEngine code for 5-10 programs nationwide (LIHEAP, WIC, Section 8, rental assistance, select Medicaid LTSS states).\n\nRigorous evaluation: AI-generated code tested against golden PR standards. Measure: (1) Test suite pass rates, (2) Code structure quality (AI-assisted review), (3) Edge case coverage, (4) Documentation completeness. Record failures, adjust prompts, retry. Track quality improvement across iterations.\n\nAI Use: Off-the-shelf LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) with prompts validated against merged PRs. Iterative prompt engineering based on failure analysis. AI-assisted code review for subjective quality assessment.\n\nDeliverable: 5-10 programs encoded with published quality metrics comparing AI vs. human baseline. Documentation of which LLMs perform best, common failure modes, prompt engineering insights. Replicable methodology for civic tech organizations.\n\nMilestone 3 (Months 4-6): LLM Benefit Estimation Evaluation & Publication\n\nResearch component: systematically measure LLM accuracy estimating benefit eligibility and amounts.\n\nGenerate test cases: Thousands of synthetic households (varying income, size, composition, assets, employment, disabilities) \u00d7 benefit programs (SNAP, TANF, LIHEAP, WIC, Medicaid, housing) \u00d7 edge cases (categorical eligibility, benefit interactions, phase-outs).\n\nThree test conditions:\nBaseline: LLM alone estimating benefits (no tools)\nIntermediate: LLM + raw policy documents from Atlas\nOptimal: LLM + PolicyEngine API access (function calling)\n\nMeasure: Accuracy vs. PolicyEngine ground truth calculations. Error analysis: Do LLMs hallucinate eligibility? Miscalculate amounts? Miss interaction effects? Invent nonexistent rules?\n\nAI Use: Multiple LLMs tested (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama). Generate diverse test cases covering demographic variation and program complexity. Analyze failure patterns to understand AI limitations for benefit calculations.\n\nPublication: Research paper documenting which LLMs perform best, how tool access improves accuracy, where AI fails dangerously (e.g., telling ineligible people they qualify), and quantitative evidence for why benefit navigation requires structured tools.\n\nDeliverable: Published research with open test suite, evaluation framework, and results dashboard. Establishes PolicyEngine as authoritative source on AI reliability for benefits.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\nAtlas: Systematic document coverage preventing link rot for targeted programs across 50 states.\n\nCode quality: AI-generated code matching human expert quality for 5-10 programs, with published metrics showing improvement trajectory across iterations. Methodology replicable by other civic tech organizations.\n\nResearch impact: First rigorous evaluation of LLM accuracy for benefit calculations. Establishes which AI approaches work, which don't, and why structured tools matter. Published results inform entire field about AI capabilities and limitations for benefits.\n\nOpen source: All improvements to PolicyEngine's Python package, Docker image, and API freely available. Anyone building benefit tools benefits\u2014not just current partners (MyFriendBen, Amplifi, Starlight, Student Basic Needs Coalition, Mirza) but future organizations, government agencies, researchers.

We build free, open-source microsimulation models that enable anyone\u2014policymakers, researchers, journalists, advocates, and the public\u2014to rigorously analyze how tax and benefit policies affect households and society.\n\nWe work toward a future where evidence-based policy analysis is not a privilege of well-resourced national organizations, but public infrastructure accessible to every community. Today, sophisticated microsimulation capacity concentrates in Washington DC and New York. Smaller metros, rural areas, and regions outside these major centers lack the infrastructure to independently analyze how policies affect their communities. This creates geographic inequality in policy knowledge\u2014some places can participate in informed debates about economic mobility policies while others cannot.\n\nOur vision is a world where a state legislator in Alabama can model how a state tax credit affects her district, where a journalist in rural Montana can analyze federal benefit changes for her readers, where a community organization in any city can understand policy impacts on the families they serve, and where benefit navigation tools can provide accurate, real-time information to people seeking support.\n\nPolicyEngine provides infrastructure used by over 100,000 people annually\u2014both policy analysts and individuals experiencing economic insecurity. Organizations serving people with lived experience depend on our calculations: MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help people identify benefits they qualify for; Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP eligibility calculations to support college students facing food insecurity. Simultaneously, policy organizations like Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our tools for analysis. Our work is strictly nonpartisan\u2014we provide neutral infrastructure that any individual or organization can use to analyze any tax or benefit proposal according to their own values and priorities.",

Our platform models federal and state programs including income taxes, the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and other programs across all 50 states.\n\nWhat we do:\n\nWe provide computational infrastructure serving organizations helping people navigate benefit systems and researchers analyzing policy impacts. Our API powers benefit access tools used by individuals experiencing economic insecurity: MyFriendBen for benefit eligibility screening, Amplifi's Benefit Navigator for accurate benefit information, and Student Basic Needs Coalition's SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity.\n\nOn the policy side, our infrastructure serves users from congressional offices to community organizations. Staff at the Joint Economic Committee, congressional offices, New York State Senate, and DC Council use our tools\u2014in some cases citing our research when proposing policies like state child tax credits. State-level organizations like Colorado Fiscal Institute and national policy organizations including Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our infrastructure, as do community organizations like Mother's Outreach Network.\n\nNEO's impact on our sustainability:\n\nThanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we built the flexible partnership capacity that now sustains our work. That funding enabled us to engage organizations lacking microsimulation access\u2014including partnerships with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center. These relationships directly resulted in Pritzker Children's Initiative supporting our child poverty analysis work. This demonstrates how flexible general operating support enables relationship-building essential for long-term sustainability.\n\nWhile Arnold Ventures supports our congressional district-level data capability and the National Science Foundation expands our open-source ecosystem, these investments provide technical infrastructure. This NEO grant would sustain the partnership capacity that enables organizations to actually use that infrastructure.\n\nHow our work leads to impact:\n\nWe make sophisticated analysis accessible to those previously lacking capacity\u2014benefit navigation tools, local journalists, state policy organizations, community groups. This democratized access enables communities to participate in policy debates with evidence, leading to policies that more effectively address economic mobility.\n\nHow we define success:\n\nSuccess means MyFriendBen can reliably help someone identify benefits, a small-town newspaper can analyze policy impacts, and a state legislator can understand constituent effects\u2014all using the same rigorous foundation. We measure reach, sustainability of partner capacity, influence on decisions advancing economic mobility, and infrastructure quality.",

        "plainText": "Quantitative analysis tells only part of the story. Our role is providing infrastructure that communities can use according to their priorities. This shapes how we address each research principle:\n\nIntersectional approach reflecting lived experience:\n\nOur microsimulation models calculate policy impacts across income, household composition, geography, age, employment, gender, race, and ethnicity. However, numbers alone cannot capture intersectional experience. This is why partnerships with organizations serving people with lived experience are essential. MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help individuals identify benefits\u2014tools for people navigating complex systems, often in crisis. PolicyEngine's leadership also has direct family experience navigating Section 8, Medicaid, and disability services, informing our commitment to accurate infrastructure. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity. Our journalism partnerships add qualitative understanding of what impacts mean for safety, dignity, and belonging.\n\nHonoring distinct worldviews:\n\nPolicyEngine provides neutral infrastructure that communities across the political spectrum use according to their own values and priorities. Conservative think tanks analyzing work incentives, progressive groups examining poverty reduction, and nonpartisan journalists all use the same rigorous foundation but interpret findings through their distinct worldviews. This pluralistic approach honors diverse ways of understanding policy impacts.\n\nDemonstrated partnership with historically marginalized communities:\n\nOur role is building infrastructure that communities can use according to their priorities. Geographic inequality in analysis capacity disproportionately affects regions with historically marginalized populations. This grant would enable partnerships focused on the American South, smaller metros, and rural areas\u2014places currently lacking sophisticated policy analysis infrastructure. Thanks to NEO's previous support, we successfully engaged organizations that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling. This grant would systematize that approach with dedicated staff providing training, technical support, and tools that remain accessible to communities after the grant period ends.\n\nExpansive understanding beyond financial outcomes:\n\nPolicyEngine calculates financial impacts\u2014poverty rates, income changes, benefit receipt. But economic mobility encompasses dignity, agency, belonging, and autonomy\u2014dimensions microsimulation cannot quantify. Our journalism partnerships address this gap. When a local reporter uses our congressional district data showing 1,200 children lifted from poverty, then interviews families about what stable childcare means for their lives, the combination captures both financial and human dimensions.\n\nInnovative uses of qualitative data:\n\nThis project systematizes partnerships pairing hyperlocal microsimulation with community storytelling. Arnold Ventures funded our congressional district and state-level capability. This grant would expand to state legislative districts and metro areas for analyzing federal and state policies at unprecedented local scales. By partnering with local journalists, we create space for ethnographic reporting. A Birmingham journalist asks \"how would this policy affect families in my city?\" then uses our tools to tell their stories. The research question originates in the community; PolicyEngine provides infrastructure.\n\nOur commitment:\n\nThis grant enables systematic support\u2014dedicated staff time for training, relationship-building, and sustained partnership with community-rooted organizations. We commit to moving at the speed of trust, listening to partner needs, and respecting diverse organizational capacities.",

        "plainText": "What we're asking to sustain:\n\nPolicyEngine provides infrastructure that organizations serving people with lived experience depend on: MyFriendBen for benefit eligibility, Amplifi's Benefit Navigator for accurate calculations, Student Basic Needs Coalition for SNAP eligibility. Arnold Ventures funded our congressional district and state-level analysis capability. This grant would expand geographic granularity to state legislative districts and metro areas while building sustained capacity to support organizations using this infrastructure.\n\nThanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we responded to partnership needs as they emerged\u2014working with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, leading to Pritzker Children's Initiative funding for child poverty work. We experimented with journalism partnerships and trained organizations without traditional modeling resources. This grant would systematize that successful model, building permanent capacity instead of ad-hoc partnerships.\n\nThe capacity we need to build:\n\nWithout dedicated staff, infrastructure goes underutilized. Organizations need training, technical assistance, and relationship management to use sophisticated tools. This grant would fund one full-time Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator providing systematic support to 12-15 organizations:\n\nLocal journalism partnerships (6 outlets, $36k): Our primary focus. The coordinator trains journalists to use PolicyEngine tools directly, develops embeddable calculators enabling readers to see personal policy impacts, and provides technical assistance. Geographic priority: Southern states, smaller metros, rural areas where journalism is resource-constrained.\n\nRegional policy organizations (4-5 partners, $18k): State-level think tanks and policy coalitions across the political spectrum needing training to use state legislative district data.\n\nCommunity organizations (2-3 partners, $6k): Direct service providers understanding benefit cliffs from daily work but lacking tools to model alternatives.\n\nWhy this builds sustainable capacity:\n\nThis creates three forms of sustainability: (1) Organizational\u2014permanent staff capacity for partnership support, not temporary projects. (2) Partner\u2014organizations learn to use infrastructure independently; skills persist after the grant ends. (3) Field\u2014open-source documentation enables any organization to adopt the approach.\n\nGeographic inequality in analysis capacity creates information asymmetry. When only well-resourced national organizations can analyze policy impacts, communities lack tools to advocate effectively. By systematically supporting local organizations, we enable evidence-based participation in policy debates. Local journalists report on reader impacts. State policy organizations analyze district-level effects. Community organizations identify which policies help their clients.\n\nBudget ($200,000): Personnel ($110,000): coordinator for training, technical assistance, relationship management. Partnership mini-grants ($60,000): 6 journalism \u00d7 $6,000, 4-5 policy orgs \u00d7 $4,000, 2-3 community orgs \u00d7 $3,000. Infrastructure ($30,000): embeddable calculators, workshops, travel, documentation.\n\nAfter one year: 6 news outlets using PolicyEngine tools with embeddable calculators deployed, 4-5 policy organizations conducting independent analysis, 2-3 community organizations using infrastructure to inform client work, open-source documentation enabling replication, proven coordinator role sustainable through diverse funding. This systematizes what NEO's prior support proved works.",
