Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group must independently build and maintain document libraries\u2014duplicating effort while links break and documents vanish. As the leading open-source rules engine powering tools helping over 100,000 Americans, PolicyEngine has seen how this foundational problem cripples the entire ecosystem. PolicyEngine Atlas solves this once, for everyone.\n\nBuilding on pilots with the Atlanta Fed, Atlas will be the first comprehensive, AI-powered archive of safety net policy documents. We'll retrieve, store, and continuously update thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals across 50 states\u2014preventing the link rot and document loss plaguing benefit delivery.\n\nAtlas goes beyond preservation. By integrating with PolicyEngine's proven rules engine, we transform static documents into a semantic knowledge graph revealing connections between programs and jurisdictions. This enables caseworkers to verify eligibility pathways with source documents, researchers to trace policy evolution, and AI tools to access authoritative sources through our web app, API, and MCP server.\n\nTo reduce administrative burden, we'll introduce the Clarity Index\u2014a scoring system that combines human expertise with AI to analyze Atlas's archived documents and identify which policy language causes errors and delays. Strategic subgrants to government-connected organizations help agencies learn from successful peers, transforming insights into clearer policy communication.\n\nPolicyEngine Atlas creates essential infrastructure for safety net transformation. By providing universal access to clear, computable, authoritative policy documents, we enable the entire ecosystem\u2014from applicants to policymakers\u2014to make our fragmented benefit system work as one.",

Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group works with fragments of the policy landscape\u2014unable to see connections across programs or jurisdictions. When Casetext shut down, thousands of legal aid organizations lost document access overnight. This fragmentation forces each organization to solve the same problem separately, wasting resources.\n\nRules-as-code developers cannot establish authoritative sources for their calculations. While PolicyEngine cites over 2,500 policy URLs, these remain disconnected fragments rather than a semantic system. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator lack direct access to regulatory text behind eligibility determinations\u2014verification requires digging through code rather than referencing documentation. Without a platform connecting computable policies to authoritative documents, tools cannot earn government trust.\n\nThe fragmentation also hides critical eligibility pathways. Categorical eligibility chains exist across programs\u2014TANF enables SNAP, SNAP qualifies for Lifeline, LIHEAP unlocks weatherization\u2014but remain invisible in traditional document search. Caseworkers cannot discover these connections systematically, meaning families miss benefits they qualify for because policies aren't computationally linked.\n\nMeanwhile, unclear policy language drives administrative burden costing billions annually. GAO calls complex regulations \"inherently error-prone,\" creating barriers preventing eligible families from accessing benefits. Yet agencies cannot learn which language patterns work because no infrastructure enables comparison across jurisdictions. States repeat mistakes; improvement remains guesswork.\n\nAs AI tools increasingly assist with benefit navigation, the lack of authoritative sources becomes critical. Large language models cannot reliably explain benefit rules without verified documentation, limiting their potential to help families.",

This flexibility lets agencies adopt Atlas at their own pace using their preferred integration approach.\n\nOur outreach focuses on understanding government document management needs. Through partnerships with MyFriendBen's Colorado agency connections and Benefit Navigator's government relationships, we learn how agencies currently manage policy documents and what barriers prevent clearer communication. These insights shape Atlas development, ensuring our open source solution meets real government needs.\n\nThe integration with PolicyEngine's encoded rules creates unique value for government. When agencies see their documents connected to actual calculations affecting constituents, they understand how unclear language creates errors. Our semantic layer reveals how their policies interact with other programs, surfacing categorical eligibility pathways they may not realize exist. This combination of document management and rules-as-code demonstrates to agencies how modern infrastructure can reduce administrative burden while improving accuracy for the families they serve.",

We offer a free web app and Python package, charge $0.02 per household API request (near cost), and provide Docker images for self-hosting at no charge. This approach established us as the standard open source rules API, generating revenue through feature enhancements (encoding new policies), enterprise support, research projects, and subgrants.\n\nAtlas follows this proven model. By 2027, operational costs will be minimal\u2014primarily cloud storage and occasional document updates. Revenue streams mirror our successful formula: enterprise support for organizations needing guaranteed uptime, contracts to add new program types or jurisdictions, custom metadata integration with specific rules engines, and government contracts for onsite installations supporting clearer policy document assembly and dissemination.\n\nOur mission drives accessibility-first pricing. Basic Atlas access remains free forever, ensuring small nonprofits can benefit. We charge only for premium features that large organizations value: guaranteed response times, custom integrations, priority support. Government agencies will increasingly seek our expertise to modernize their document management workflows, creating sustainable revenue while improving public services.\n\nTechnical efficiency ensures long-term viability. AI training costs decrease as models learn patterns. Community contributions through bounties reduce acquisition costs. Automated monitoring minimizes manual oversight. GitHub's infrastructure handles storage and versioning at minimal cost for 5,000 documents.\n\nThis sustainability model\u2014proven through PolicyEngine's growth to serving over 100,000 Americans\u2014ensures Atlas becomes permanent infrastructure.
