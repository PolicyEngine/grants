        "plainText": "Cyberinfrastructure Need\n\nThe Crisis in Economic Policy Modeling\n\nEconomic policy research faces a critical cyberinfrastructure gap: the most impactful models for analyzing tax and benefit reforms are locked behind proprietary walls or restricted data access agreements. This \"closed ecosystem\" paradigm severely limits scientific reproducibility, restricts the diversity of the research community, and bottlenecks the speed of evidence-based policymaking.\nThe \"Black Box\" Problem\nMajor policy analyses--from Social Security solvency projections to Child Tax Credit impact assessments--are currently conducted using legacy, closed-source microsimulation models (e.g., the Urban Institute's DynaSim, the Congressional Budget Office's CBOLT, and the Social Security Administration's MINT). \nLack of Reproducibility: Outside researchers cannot inspect the source code or replicate findings, violating the core tenet of scientific inquiry.\nInstitutional Gatekeeping: Access to these models is restricted to government agencies or well-funded think tanks, effectively excluding academic researchers, students, and smaller non-profits.\nOpaque Methodologies: Critical assumptions about behavioral responses, macro-economic feedbacks, and demographic transitions are often hard-coded and undocumented, preventing sensitivity analysis.\nThe Data Access Bottleneck\nHigh-quality microsimulation requires individual-level data on income, demographics, and program participation. However, the \"gold standard\" administrative data (IRS tax records, SSA earnings histories) is legally restricted.\nPublic Data Limitations: Publicly available datasets like the Current Population Survey (CPS) suffer from measurement error (e.g., underreporting of benefits) and lack longitudinal history (crucial for retirement modeling).\nImputation Silos: Individual research groups build ad-hoc, one-off imputation models to fix these data gaps, leading to duplicated effort and inconsistent baselines across the field.\nComputational Antiquity\nMany existing legacy models run on mainframe-era architectures (SAS, Fortran) that cannot scale to modern cloud environments.\nSlow Feedback Loops: Simulating complex reforms can take hours or days, preventing real-time iteration and optimization.\nInability to Scale: These systems cannot leverage parallel processing to run the millions of sensitivity tests required for robust uncertainty quantification.\n\nThe Solution: PolicyEngine Cyberinfrastructure\n\nPolicyEngine proposes a paradigm shift: a cloud-native, open-source cyberinfrastructure that democratizes access to \"gold standard\" modeling capabilities.\n\nA. Democratizing Longitudinal Analysis (The Social Security Use Case)\nWe will build the first open-source dynamic microsimulation model for Social Security, replacing the need for proprietary tools like DynaSim. By integrating:\nSynthetic Data Generation: Using Quantile Regression Forests to impute realistic lifetime earnings trajectories onto public data.\nMassive-Scale Calibration: Using gradient descent to align synthetic populations with thousands of administrative targets.\nVectorized Simulation: Executing lifetime benefit rules in sub-second timeframes.\n\nThis infrastructure will allow any researcher to reproduce official government scores, test alternative reform proposals, and publish fully reproducible findings.\n\nB. Infrastructure for the Broader Community\nThis project is not just about Social Security; it builds the computational plumbing for the next generation of economic research:\nmicroimpute: A generalized framework for machine learning-based data imputation, usable for health, education, and climate research.\nmicrocalibrate: A high-performance calibration engine that replaces manual \"reweighting\" with differentiable optimization.\nPolicyEngine Core: A standardized, vectorized rules engine that decouples policy logic from simulation mechanics, allowing domain experts to contribute code without needing to be software engineers.\n\nBy transitioning the field from \"artisanal,\" closed models to scalable, open cyberinfrastructure, PolicyEngine will unleash a wave of innovation in public policy research, enabling scientists to tackle complex, dynamic problems--from climate adaptation to intergenerational mobility--with tools that are transparent, reproducible, and free to use.",

        "file": "docs/cssi/responses/technical_approach.md",
        "plainText": "Technical Approach\n\nPolicyEngine Cyberinfrastructure is built on three integrated open-source libraries that collectively solve the \"end-to-end\" problem of modern microsimulation: generating representative data (microimpute), aligning it with administrative truth (microcalibrate), and executing complex policy logic at scale (policyengine-core).\nSynthetic Data Generation: microimpute\n\nThe foundational bottleneck in policy research is data access. Longitudinal panels (like PSID) are too small for distributional analysis, while large administrative files (IRS, SSA) are restricted. microimpute solves this by applying machine learning to fuse these datasets.\n\nArchitecture\n   Algorithm: Quantile Regression Forests (QRF). Unlike standard regression which predicts a mean, QRF predicts the entire conditional distribution of a target variable (e.g., future earnings) given a set of covariates.\n   Implementation: Built on scikit-learn and optimized with numba for performance.\n   Workflow:\nTrain: Train QRF models on small, rich longitudinal datasets (e.g., PSID) to learn the dynamics of income mobility and demographic transitions.\nImpute: Apply these models to large, representative cross-sectional files (e.g., CPS) to impute synthetic longitudinal histories for millions of individuals.\nValidate: Automatically compare statistical properties of the synthetic panel (e.g., Gini coefficients of lifetime earnings) against withheld validation sets.\n\nThis approach allows us to distribute a \"Synthetic Social Security Panel\" that contains no PII but statistically replicates the properties of restricted administrative data.\nDifferentiable Calibration: microcalibrate\n\nSynthetic data must be \"calibrated\" (reweighted) to match known aggregate totals (e.g., total Social Security outlays, population counts by age/race). Traditional \"raking\" methods fail with high-dimensional targets.\n\nArchitecture\n   Algorithm: Gradient Descent optimization of survey weights. We define a loss function $L(w) = (Sigma) (Targeti - WeightedSumi(w))^2 + (lambda) \\cdot \\text{Divergence}(w, w_{base})$, where we minimize the error in aggregate targets while keeping weights close to their base survey values.\n   Differentiation: We use JAX to automatically differentiate the loss function with respect to the weight vector $w$. This allows us to calibrate millions of weights against thousands of targets efficiently.\n   Performance: By leveraging GPU acceleration via JAX, microcalibrate can solve calibration problems in seconds that take hours with traditional iterative proportional fitting (IPF).\nVectorized Microsimulation: policyengine-core\n\nThe core simulation engine is designed to decouple policy logic (the rules) from computational mechanics.\n\nArchitecture\n   Vectorization: All calculations are vectorized using NumPy. Instead of iterating over households (which is slow in Python), we operate on entire population arrays simultaneously.\n       Example: tax = income  rate computes taxes for 100,000 households in a single CPU instruction cycle.\n   Dependency Graph: Policy parameters and variables are organized into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The engine automatically determines the optimal compute order and caches intermediate results.\n   Scalability:\n       Single Node: Can simulate the US tax-benefit system for the Current Population Survey (200k records) in <500ms.\n       Distributed: For massive sensitivity analyses (e.g., 1M+ variations), we use Ray to distribute simulation tasks across a cluster of cloud instances.\nSoftware Engineering & Quality Assurance\n\n   Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions pipeline runs 8,600+ unit tests on every commit.\n   Continuous Delivery: Packages are automatically published to PyPI (pip install policyengine-us).\n   Documentation: All parameters are documented with citations to the US Code (Title 26/42) or CFR, automatically linked in the API reference.",

        "plainText": "Intellectual Merit\n\nThe PolicyEngine cyberinfrastructure is designed to overcome the computational and data barriers that currently restrict policy research to static, cross-sectional analysis or rely on closed-source, proprietary models. By providing scalable, open-source tools for microsimulation, data imputation, and calibration, this project enables a new generation of dynamic, longitudinal research.\n\nPrimary Use Case: Democratizing Social Security Analysis\n\nThe most significant immediate application of the proposed infrastructure is the development of the first open-source, publicly available Social Security dynamic microsimulation model.\n\nThe Scientific Challenge\nCurrently, sophisticated lifetime benefit analysis for Social Security is restricted to a few institutions using proprietary or closed-source models:\nDynaSim (Urban Institute): Proprietary.\nCBOLT (Congressional Budget Office): Internal use only.\nMINT (Social Security Administration): Restricted data access.\n\nThis exclusivity limits scientific reproducibility, restricts public understanding of reform proposals (e.g., raising the retirement age, changing cost-of-living adjustments), and prevents independent researchers from validating official projections.\n\nInfrastructure-Enabled Solution\nThe PolicyEngine cyberinfrastructure enables a transparent alternative by integrating three key technical components:\nSynthetic Panel Construction (via microimpute): \nChallenge: Publicly available longitudinal data (e.g., PSID) is too small for robust distributional analysis, while large administrative data is restricted.\nSolution: The cyberinfrastructure supports the training of Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) on smaller longitudinal datasets to impute realistic lifetime earnings trajectories onto large cross-sectional files (CPS). This requires significant computational resources for training and validation which our platform provides.\nMassive-Scale Calibration (via microcalibrate):\nChallenge: Synthetic data must match hundreds of administrative targets (e.g., aggregate earnings by cohort, disability incidence rates) to be credible.\nSolution: Our gradient descent-based reweighting infrastructure allows for calibration against complex, high-dimensional targets, ensuring the synthetic panel accurately reflects the US population's demographic and economic characteristics.\nHigh-Performance Rules Engine:\nChallenge: Calculating lifetime benefits requires executing complex statutory rules for every year of a simulated life, for millions of synthetic individuals.\nSolution: PolicyEngine's vectorized, cloud-native rules engine can execute these simulations in parallel, turning week-long computation tasks into minutes.\n\nScientific Impact\nThis capability transforms Social Security research from a \"black box\" trusted only on authority to an open scientific enterprise. Researchers can:\nValidate official scoring of legislation.\nExperiment with novel distributional metrics (e.g., lifetime net tax rates by race and gender).\nReproduce results completely, from data generation to final impact charts.\n\nBroader Research Applications\n\nThe same infrastructure supporting the Social Security model extends to other domains:\n\nDynamic Climate Policy Analysis\nApplication: Modeling the lifetime incidence of carbon pricing and green energy subsidies.\nEnablement: Integrating physical climate models with economic microsimulation to project household adaptation over decades.\n\nEducation and Human Capital Formation\nApplication: Estimating the long-term ROI of early childhood interventions (e.g., Child Tax Credit expansion).\nEnablement: Linking short-term income shocks in childhood to longitudinal earnings outcomes using the same synthetic panel methodologies.\n\nHealth Economics\nApplication: Simulating the long-term fiscal impacts of healthcare reforms (e.g., single-payer systems).\nEnablement: Modeling disease progression and healthcare utilization transitions within the dynamic framework.\n\nConclusion\nBy building the \"plumbing\"--scalable imputation, calibration, and simulation--PolicyEngine allows domain experts to focus on the physics of their models (behavioral responses, transition probabilities) rather than the engineering of the simulation. The Social Security model serves as the pathfinder, demonstrating that open-source cyberinfrastructure can match or exceed the capabilities of legacy proprietary systems.",

By democratizing access to sophisticated modeling tools, we empower a diverse range of stakeholders to participate in evidence-based decision-making.\nDemocratizing Policy Analysis\nCurrently, the ability to \"score\" legislation (estimate its cost and impact) is concentrated in a few elite institutions (CBO, JCT, major think tanks). This centralization creates an information asymmetry where community organizations, journalists, and smaller academic departments cannot independently verify claims.\n   Impact: We enable any user--from a high school student to a state legislator--to run the same quality of analysis as the Congressional Budget Office.\n   Mechanism: Our free, web-based interface and open-source Python packages lower the barrier to entry from \"access to a mainframe and restricted data\" to \"an internet connection.\"\nEnhancing STEM Education in Economics\nEconomic curriculum often relies on stylized, static models because real-world microsimulation is too complex to teach.\n   Impact: We provide a \"laboratory\" for economics students to experiment with tax and benefit rules, visualizing the immediate distributional consequences of policy changes.\n   Mechanism: We are developing curriculum modules with partner universities (e.g., UC Berkeley, Georgetown) that integrate PolicyEngine into public finance and econometrics courses, training the next generation of data-literate policy analysts.\nAdvancing Open Science\nThe \"replication crisis\" in social sciences is exacerbated by closed-source models.\n   Impact: By making the entire modeling pipeline--from data imputation to rule calculation--open source, we establish a new standard for transparency.\n   Mechanism: Every simulation result is linked to a specific Git commit hash, ensuring perfect reproducibility. We publish our validation reports automatically, allowing the community to audit our accuracy against official benchmarks.\nSupporting Underrepresented Communities\nPolicies often have complex, heterogeneous impacts on different demographic groups that aggregate statistics miss.\n   Impact: Our focus on distributional analysis (not just aggregate costs) highlights impacts on marginalized communities, racial minorities, and low-income households.\n   Mechanism: Our synthetic data generation (microimpute) explicitly models under-represented populations, ensuring they are statistically visible in policy simulations where they might otherwise be smoothed over by small sample sizes in public data.",

Our Enhanced Current Population Survey (Enhanced CPS) methodology has proven that synthetic data combined with modern machine learning and calibration can match gold-standard models that rely on confidential IRS files. This section describes our comprehensive data architecture, validation framework, and plans to extend these capabilities to support diverse research communities.\n\nCore Innovation: We transform publicly available survey data into research-grade microdata through a two-stage process: (1) machine learning-based imputation using quantile regression forests, and (2) gradient descent calibration to thousands of administrative targets. This approach enables full reproducibility while maintaining distributional accuracy across income sources, demographic groups, and policy outcomes.\n\nData Sources and Integration\n\nSurvey Microdata\n\nOur primary data infrastructure builds on harmonized survey datasets that provide comprehensive demographic and economic coverage:\n\nCurrent Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC):\nPrimary cross-sectional data source for US microsimulation\nAnnual sample of ~150,000 individuals in ~75,000 households\nComprehensive income data across wages, self-employment, transfers, and investment income\nDetailed demographics including age, education, geography, family structure\nPublic domain availability ensures full reproducibility\n\nPanel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID):\nLongest-running US household panel survey (since 1968)\nEssential for longitudinal earnings dynamics and lifecycle modeling\nTraining data for quantile regression forests that impute lifetime earnings trajectories\nEnables dynamic microsimulation for Social Security, retirement, and intergenerational policy analysis\nPublicly accessible with restricted-use agreements\n\nSurvey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP):\nShort-term panel structure (3-4 years) with monthly income detail\nDetailed program participation data for SNAP, SSI, Medicaid validation\nWealth modules supplement CPS asset data\nServes as additional training source for ML imputation\n\nInternational Survey Harmonization:\nUK: Family Resources Survey (FRS), Living Costs and Food Survey (LCFS), Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS)\nCanada: Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID), Survey of Household Spending (SHS)\nAustralia: Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA)\nCross-national comparative analysis through Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and OECD databases\n\nAdministrative Data Integration\n\nWhile individual-level administrative data remains restricted, we leverage published aggregate statistics for calibration and validation:\n\nIRS Statistics of Income (SOI):\nTax return aggregates by income level, filing status, state\nDetailed breakdowns of income sources, deductions, credits\nPrimary calibration targets for tax microsimulation\nOver 4,000 calibration targets from SOI alone\n\nSocial Security Administration (SSA):\nAnnual Statistical Supplement with benefit distributions by type, age, state\nOASDI Trustees Reports with long-run financial projections\nEarnings distributions for covered workers\nBeneficiary counts and average benefit amounts\nEssential for Social Security microsimulation validation\n\nCensus Bureau:\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) with 3+ million annual respondents\nPopulation estimates and projections by age, sex, race, geography\nSmall Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE)\nGeographic micro-targeting capabilities\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA):\nReal-time economic indicators via FRED API\nNational accounts aggregates for top-down validation\nConsumer Price Index for inflation adjustments\nEmployment statistics for labor market calibration\n\nReal-Time Data Integration\n\nOur infrastructure supports automated ingestion of policy and economic updates:\n\nLegislative and Regulatory Tracking:\nAutomated parsing of tax law changes from IRS publications\nState legislative database integration for sub-national policy variation\nBenefit program rule updates from federal and state agencies\nVersion control of policy parameters tied to effective dates\n\nEconomic Indicators:\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API integration\nAutomatic quarterly updates of wage indices, inflation, interest rates\nMarket data feeds for wealth and investment modeling\nDemographic projections from Census and SSA\n\nEnhanced CPS: Proven Synthetic Data Innovation\n\nThe Reproducibility Challenge\n\nAll major US tax-benefit models historically relied on the IRS Public Use File (PUF), which cannot be publicly shared due to confidentiality restrictions. This created a reproducibility crisis: researchers could not verify published analyses, test alternative methodologies, or independently evaluate policy proposals. Even well-funded institutions required special data access agreements, excluding academic researchers, civil society organizations, and international scholars.\n\nPolicyEngine solved this problem. Our Enhanced CPS is the only publicly available microdata producing tax-benefit estimates that match restricted-access models. Congressional offices use PolicyEngine for actual legislative analysis. Academic researchers cite our estimates in peer-reviewed publications. International researchers replicate our methodology for their countries. This proves synthetic data can achieve research-grade accuracy.\n\nTwo-Stage Methodology\n\nStage 1: Machine Learning Imputation\n\nWe employ quantile regression forests (QRF) to impute missing or underreported income components onto the CPS:\n\nQuantile Regression Forests predict the full conditional distribution of income variables, not just means. This preserves heterogeneity within demographic cells and captures realistic variation in income sources across the distribution. For each income type (self-employment, interest, dividends, retirement income), we:\nTrain QRF models on data sources with superior measurement (e.g., SIPP for transfer income, Survey of Consumer Finances for capital income)\nPredict conditional quantiles on the CPS using shared demographic and economic predictors\nSample from predicted quantile distributions to generate synthetic values\nPreserve covariance structure through copula methods\n\nThe CPS is cloned into two copies: one filling missing variables, one replacing existing with imputed. These concatenate to create the Extended CPS with doubled sample size (~150,000 households) and comprehensive income detail.\n\nStage 2: Gradient Descent Calibration\n\nWe reweight the Extended CPS to match over 7,000 administrative targets simultaneously using gradient descent optimization:\n\nCalibration targets come from IRS SOI, Census, CBO, and other authoritative sources, spanning:\nIncome distributions by source and filing status\nTax liability and credits by income level\nState-level aggregates for sub-national accuracy\nDemographic cross-tabs (age \u00d7 income, education \u00d7 state)\nBenefit program participation rates and spending\n\nOptimization framework employs PyTorch with Adam optimizer:\n\nThe algorithm iterates until convergence, typically 5,000-10,000 epochs. Final weights range from 0.1 to 10, maintaining reasonable variance while achieving tight target matching.\n\nValidation Results\n\nRevenue Estimates: Enhanced CPS tax revenue matches Joint Committee on Taxation estimates within 2% for major provisions (EITC expansion, Child Tax Credit, top marginal rate changes). This is the gold standard for US tax modeling.\n\nDistributional Analysis: Our quintile-level burden tables match Tax Policy Center's published analyses, which use the restricted PUF. Poverty and inequality metrics align with Census official statistics.\n\nGeographic Accuracy: State-level revenue estimates correlate >0.95 with actual IRS collections. Congressional district estimates enable precise constituency impact analysis.\n\nExternal Validation: Over 50 academic papers, 100+ media citations, and adoption by multiple legislative offices demonstrate real-world credibility.\n\nComputational Infrastructure\n\nTools Developed:\nmicroimpute: Open-source ML imputation library supporting QRF, random forests, deep learning, and traditional methods\nmicrocalibrate: Gradient descent reweighting with PyTorch backend, supporting GPU acceleration and distributed optimization\nFull pipeline available at github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us-data\n\nPerformance:\nEnhanced CPS generation: 6-8 hours on standard compute (32 cores, 128GB RAM)\nIncremental updates: 1-2 hours when only calibration targets change\nFully automated via GitHub Actions, ensuring reproducibility\n\nData Versioning: Each Enhanced CPS version is tagged with:\nSource survey vintage\nCalibration target snapshot\nImputation model specifications\nFull lineage of transformations\nValidation metrics dashboard\n\nDynamic Microsimulation Infrastructure\n\nLongitudinal Data Innovation\n\nOur Social Security dynamic microsimulation model extends the Enhanced CPS methodology from cross-sectional to longitudinal analysis. This represents the first open-source model comparable to proprietary tools like Urban Institute's DYNASIM and CBO's CBOLT.\n\nThe Challenge: Social Security benefits depend on lifetime earnings histories (up to 35 years), but cross-sectional surveys only capture current year. Panel surveys like PSID have longitudinal data but sample sizes 20\u00d7 smaller than CPS.\n\nOur Solution: Statistical matching combines CPS sample size with PSID dynamics:\nTrain quantile regression forests on PSID to learn earnings transition patterns by age, education, sex, race\nImpute full earnings histories (age 18-retirement) onto Enhanced CPS respondents\nModel demographic transitions (marriage, divorce, disability, mortality) using hazard models\nAge the panel forward year-by-year with continued calibration to SSA projections\nCalculate benefits using PolicyEngine's comprehensive Social Security rules engine\n\nQuantile Regression for Panel Construction\n\nTraditional statistical matching uses conditional means, losing distributional detail. We employ quantile regression forests specifically to preserve:\n\nEarnings Mobility Patterns:\nPersistence at bottom quartile vs. top quartile (asymmetric mobility)\nAge-earnings profiles varying by education and cohort\nVariance decomposition into permanent vs. transitory components\nRealistic representation of high-income earner trajectories\n\nTraining and Validation:\nTrain on PSID longitudinal records (1968-present, 18,000+ persons)\nValidate against PSID hold-out sample (20% test set)\nCompare predicted transition matrices to observed PSID dynamics\nMatch published studies of earnings mobility and lifecycle profiles\n\nImputation to CPS:\nFor each CPS respondent, predict conditional earnings distribution at each future age\nSample from predicted distributions to generate synthetic earnings path\nMultiple imputation (m=5-10) to propagate uncertainty\nMaintain family structure and correlations across household members\n\nMulti-Target Calibration\n\nThe synthetic panel is calibrated to SSA administrative targets:\n\nCross-Sectional Targets (annual):\nCovered earnings distributions by age, sex\nBeneficiary counts by type (retirement, disability, survivors)\nAverage benefit amounts by claiming age\nState-level aggregates\n\nLongitudinal Targets:\nAge-earnings profiles by birth cohort\nCareer length distributions\nBenefit replacement rates by lifetime earnings percentile\nWidow/widower benefit patterns\n\nFiscal Targets:\nTotal OASDI benefit payments\nTrust fund income and outgo\nLong-run actuarial balance\n\nCalibration uses the same gradient descent framework as Enhanced CPS, now with time-varying weights that preserve both cross-sectional and longitudinal accuracy.\n\nDemographic Modeling\n\nCritical lifecycle transitions affect Social Security eligibility and benefits:\n\nMarriage and Divorce:\nHazard models by age, education, earnings\nSpousal benefit eligibility\nDivorced spouse benefits after 10-year marriages\n\nDisability Onset:\nDisability Insurance (DI) claiming by age, occupation, health\nConversion to retirement benefits at full retirement age\nWork history requirements\n\nMortality:\nDifferential mortality by socioeconomic status\nSurvivor benefit eligibility\nLife expectancy assumptions aligned with SSA actuaries\n\nAll transition models estimated from survey data (SIPP, HRS) and validated against

As the leading open-source rules engine powering tools helping over 100,000 Americans, PolicyEngine has seen how this foundational problem cripples the entire ecosystem. PolicyEngine Atlas solves this once, for everyone.\n\nBuilding on pilots with the Atlanta Fed, Atlas will be the first comprehensive, AI-powered archive of safety net policy documents. We'll retrieve, store, and continuously update thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals across 50 states\u2014preventing the link rot and document loss plaguing benefit delivery.\n\nAtlas goes beyond preservation. By integrating with PolicyEngine's proven rules engine, we transform static documents into a semantic knowledge graph revealing connections between programs and jurisdictions. This enables caseworkers to verify eligibility pathways with source documents, researchers to trace policy evolution, and AI tools to access authoritative sources through our web app, API, and MCP server.\n\nTo reduce administrative burden, we'll introduce the Clarity Index\u2014a scoring system that combines human expertise with AI to analyze Atlas's archived documents and identify which policy language causes errors and delays. Strategic subgrants to government-connected organizations help agencies learn from successful peers, transforming insights into clearer policy communication.\n\nPolicyEngine Atlas creates essential infrastructure for safety net transformation.

Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group works with fragments of the policy landscape\u2014unable to see connections across programs or jurisdictions. When Casetext shut down, thousands of legal aid organizations lost document access overnight. This fragmentation forces each organization to solve the same problem separately, wasting resources.\n\nRules-as-code developers cannot establish authoritative sources for their calculations. While PolicyEngine cites over 2,500 policy URLs, these remain disconnected fragments rather than a semantic system. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator lack direct access to regulatory text behind eligibility determinations\u2014verification requires digging through code rather than referencing documentation. Without a platform connecting computable policies to authoritative documents, tools cannot earn government trust.\n\nThe fragmentation also hides critical eligibility pathways. Categorical eligibility chains exist across programs\u2014TANF enables SNAP, SNAP qualifies for Lifeline, LIHEAP unlocks weatherization\u2014but remain invisible in traditional document search. Caseworkers cannot discover these connections systematically, meaning families miss benefits they qualify for because policies aren't computationally linked.\n\nMeanwhile, unclear policy language drives administrative burden costing billions annually. GAO calls complex regulations \"inherently error-prone,\" creating barriers preventing eligible families from accessing benefits. Yet agencies cannot learn which language patterns work because no infrastructure enables comparison across jurisdictions. States repeat mistakes; improvement remains guesswork.\n\nAs AI tools increasingly assist with benefit navigation, the lack of authoritative sources becomes critical.

For accessibility, we track document growth from 237 baseline to 5,000 by Year 2, Atlas API usage reaching thousands of monthly lookups, and partner integrations expanding from four current PolicyEngine customers to dozens using Atlas for source verification.\n\nFor clarity, our Clarity Index scores all 5,000 documents, identifying problematic language patterns. We'll measure whether agencies adopt simpler language after seeing peer comparisons, track reduction in caseworker interpretation errors, and document time saved answering eligibility questions. Case studies will show how organizations using Atlas provide more accurate guidance\u2014like caseworkers correctly explaining SNAP-to-Lifeline categorical eligibility.\n\nFor computability, we evaluate how Atlas accelerates rules-as-code development. We'll publish studies showing how documents aid automating RAC processes and measure usage by other RAC providers (Atlanta Fed, GCO, Urban, NBER, Benefit Kitchen) building on our infrastructure. Success metrics include reduced time encoding new policies, increased accuracy of rules verified against sources, and API adoption by RAC developers.\n\nWe'll budget for independent Year 2 evaluation assessing system-level impact: governments adopting clearer policy language based on Clarity findings, benefit screeners confidently embedding Atlas on their sites, agencies contributing documents directly to Atlas, and ecosystem-wide adoption of open computational standards. The evaluator will survey partners, analyze usage data, and validate whether we've achieved our mission of making fragmented policies work as one.",

        "plainText": "PolicyEngine's mission is to compute the impact of public policy for the world. We build free, open-source microsimulation models that enable anyone\u2014policymakers, researchers, journalists, advocates, and the public\u2014to rigorously analyze how tax and benefit policies affect households and society.\n\nWe work toward a future where evidence-based policy analysis is not a privilege of well-resourced national organizations, but public infrastructure accessible to every community. Today, sophisticated microsimulation capacity concentrates in Washington DC and New York. Smaller metros, rural areas, and regions outside these major centers lack the infrastructure to independently analyze how policies affect their communities. This creates geographic inequality in policy knowledge\u2014some places can participate in informed debates about economic mobility policies while others cannot.\n\nOur vision is a world where a state legislator in Alabama can model how a state tax credit affects her district, where a journalist in rural Montana can analyze federal benefit changes for her readers, where a community organization in any city can understand policy impacts on the families they serve, and where benefit navigation tools can provide accurate, real-time information to people seeking support.\n\nPolicyEngine provides infrastructure used by over 100,000 people annually\u2014both policy analysts and individuals experiencing economic insecurity. Organizations serving people with lived experience depend on our calculations: MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help people identify benefits they qualify for; Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP eligibility calculations to support college students facing food insecurity. Simultaneously, policy organizations like Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our tools for analysis. Our work is strictly nonpartisan\u2014we provide neutral infrastructure that any individual or organization can use to analyze any tax or benefit proposal according to their own values and priorities.",

Our platform models federal and state programs including income taxes, the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and other programs across all 50 states.\n\nWhat we do:\n\nWe provide computational infrastructure serving organizations helping people navigate benefit systems and researchers analyzing policy impacts. Our API powers benefit access tools used by individuals experiencing economic insecurity: MyFriendBen for benefit eligibility screening, Amplifi's Benefit Navigator for accurate benefit information, and Student Basic Needs Coalition's SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity.\n\nOn the policy side, our infrastructure serves users from congressional offices to community organizations. Staff at the Joint Economic Committee, congressional offices, New York State Senate, and DC Council use our tools\u2014in some cases citing our research when proposing policies like state child tax credits. State-level organizations like Colorado Fiscal Institute and national policy organizations including Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center use our infrastructure, as do community organizations like Mother's Outreach Network.\n\nNEO's impact on our sustainability:\n\nThanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we built the flexible partnership capacity that now sustains our work. That funding enabled us to engage organizations lacking microsimulation access\u2014including partnerships with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center. These relationships directly resulted in Pritzker Children's Initiative supporting our child poverty analysis work. This demonstrates how flexible general operating support enables relationship-building essential for long-term sustainability.\n\nWhile Arnold Ventures supports our congressional district-level data capability and the National Science Foundation expands our open-source ecosystem, these investments provide technical infrastructure. This NEO grant would sustain the partnership capacity that enables organizations to actually use that infrastructure.\n\nHow our work leads to impact:\n\nWe make sophisticated analysis accessible to those previously lacking capacity\u2014benefit navigation tools, local journalists, state policy organizations, community groups. This democratized access enables communities to participate in policy debates with evidence, leading to policies that more effectively address economic mobility.\n\nHow we define success:\n\nSuccess means MyFriendBen can reliably help someone identify benefits, a small-town newspaper can analyze policy impacts, and a state legislator can understand constituent effects\u2014all using the same rigorous foundation.

This shapes how we address each research principle:\n\nIntersectional approach reflecting lived experience:\n\nOur microsimulation models calculate policy impacts across income, household composition, geography, age, employment, gender, race, and ethnicity. However, numbers alone cannot capture intersectional experience. This is why partnerships with organizations serving people with lived experience are essential. MyFriendBen and Amplifi's Benefit Navigator use our API to help individuals identify benefits\u2014tools for people navigating complex systems, often in crisis. PolicyEngine's leadership also has direct family experience navigating Section 8, Medicaid, and disability services, informing our commitment to accurate infrastructure. Student Basic Needs Coalition uses our SNAP calculations supporting college students facing food insecurity. Our journalism partnerships add qualitative understanding of what impacts mean for safety, dignity, and belonging.\n\nHonoring distinct worldviews:\n\nPolicyEngine provides neutral infrastructure that communities across the political spectrum use according to their own values and priorities. Conservative think tanks analyzing work incentives, progressive groups examining poverty reduction, and nonpartisan journalists all use the same rigorous foundation but interpret findings through their distinct worldviews. This pluralistic approach honors diverse ways of understanding policy impacts.\n\nDemonstrated partnership with historically marginalized communities:\n\nOur role is building infrastructure that communities can use according to their priorities. Geographic inequality in analysis capacity disproportionately affects regions with historically marginalized populations. This grant would enable partnerships focused on the American South, smaller metros, and rural areas\u2014places currently lacking sophisticated policy analysis infrastructure. Thanks to NEO's previous support, we successfully engaged organizations that historically lacked access to microsimulation modeling. This grant would systematize that approach with dedicated staff providing training, technical support, and tools that remain accessible to communities after the grant period ends.\n\nExpansive understanding beyond financial outcomes:\n\nPolicyEngine calculates financial impacts\u2014poverty rates, income changes, benefit receipt. But economic mobility encompasses dignity, agency, belonging, and autonomy\u2014dimensions microsimulation cannot quantify. Our journalism partnerships address this gap. When a local reporter uses our congressional district data showing 1,200 children lifted from poverty, then interviews families about what stable childcare means for their lives, the combination captures both financial and human dimensions.\n\nInnovative uses of qualitative data:\n\nThis project systematizes partnerships pairing hyperlocal microsimulation with community storytelling. Arnold Ventures funded our congressional district and state-level capability. This grant would expand to state legislative districts and metro areas for analyzing federal and state policies at unprecedented local scales. By partnering with local journalists, we create space for ethnographic reporting. A Birmingham journalist asks \"how would this policy affect families in my city?\" then uses our tools to tell their stories. The research question originates in the community; PolicyEngine provides infrastructure.\n\nOur commitment:\n\nThis grant enables systematic support\u2014dedicated staff time for training, relationship-building, and sustained partnership with community-rooted organizations. We commit to moving at the speed of trust, listening to partner needs, and respecting diverse organizational capacities.",

Arnold Ventures funded our congressional district and state-level analysis capability. This grant would expand geographic granularity to state legislative districts and metro areas while building sustained capacity to support organizations using this infrastructure.\n\nThanks to NEO's prior general operating support, we responded to partnership needs as they emerged\u2014working with Niskanen Center and Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, leading to Pritzker Children's Initiative funding for child poverty work. We experimented with journalism partnerships and trained organizations without traditional modeling resources. This grant would systematize that successful model, building permanent capacity instead of ad-hoc partnerships.\n\nThe capacity we need to build:\n\nWithout dedicated staff, infrastructure goes underutilized. Organizations need training, technical assistance, and relationship management to use sophisticated tools. This grant would fund one full-time Community Partnerships & Technical Assistance Coordinator providing systematic support to 12-15 organizations:\n\nLocal journalism partnerships (6 outlets, $36k): Our primary focus. The coordinator trains journalists to use PolicyEngine tools directly, develops embeddable calculators enabling readers to see personal policy impacts, and provides technical assistance. Geographic priority: Southern states, smaller metros, rural areas where journalism is resource-constrained.\n\nRegional policy organizations (4-5 partners, $18k): State-level think tanks and policy coalitions across the political spectrum needing training to use state legislative district data.\n\nCommunity organizations (2-3 partners, $6k): Direct service providers understanding benefit cliffs from daily work but lacking tools to model alternatives.\n\nWhy this builds sustainable capacity:\n\nThis creates three forms of sustainability: (1) Organizational\u2014permanent staff capacity for partnership support, not temporary projects. (2) Partner\u2014organizations learn to use infrastructure independently; skills persist after the grant ends. (3) Field\u2014open-source documentation enables any organization to adopt the approach.\n\nGeographic inequality in analysis capacity creates information asymmetry. When only well-resourced national organizations can analyze policy impacts, communities lack tools to advocate effectively. By systematically supporting local organizations, we enable evidence-based participation in policy debates. Local journalists report on reader impacts. State policy organizations analyze district-level effects. Community organizations identify which policies help their clients.\n\nBudget ($200,000): Personnel ($110,000): coordinator for training, technical assistance, relationship management. Partnership mini-grants ($60,000): 6 journalism \u00d7 $6,000, 4-5 policy orgs \u00d7 $4,000, 2-3 community orgs \u00d7 $3,000. Infrastructure ($30,000): embeddable calculators, workshops, travel, documentation.\n\nAfter one year: 6 news outlets using PolicyEngine tools with embeddable calculators deployed, 4-5 policy organizations conducting independent analysis, 2-3 community organizations using infrastructure to inform client work, open-source documentation enabling replication, proven coordinator role sustainable through diverse funding.
