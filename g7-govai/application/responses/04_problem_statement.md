Government workers and citizens struggle to navigate complex, interacting benefit rules across federal and provincial jurisdictions. Caseworkers spend hours cross-referencing regulations; citizens miss benefits they qualify for.

PolicyEngine solves this by encoding 9,000+ parameters from legislative sources across 200+ programs, calculating benefit amounts and modeling how programs interact—including federal-provincial dependencies. AI then explains each result in plain language: which thresholds applied, how amounts were calculated, and links to source legislation.

Workers input household details once and instantly see eligibility across all programs with clear explanations of why—reducing cognitive load while ensuring consistent, auditable determinations.
