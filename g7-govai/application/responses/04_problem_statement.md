# Problem Statement

## The Barrier

Citizens across G7 countries struggle to understand how tax and benefit policies affect them personally. Tax codes span thousands of pages, benefit eligibility rules are fragmented across agencies, and policy changes are announced in technical language inaccessible to the public.

This creates a critical barrier to democratic participation:
- Citizens cannot evaluate policy proposals that will affect their families
- Policymakers lack feedback on how their proposals impact real households
- Journalists cannot accurately explain policy impacts to the public
- Vulnerable populations miss benefits they're entitled to receive

## Why This Matters for AI Adoption

Governments want to use AI to improve citizen services, but face a trust gap. Citizens are skeptical of "black box" algorithms making decisions about their benefits and taxes. The solution isn't to hide AI—it's to use AI transparently, letting citizens see exactly how policies affect them.

PolicyEngine demonstrates that AI can enhance democratic accountability rather than undermine it.
