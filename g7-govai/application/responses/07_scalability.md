# Scalability

## Cross-Country Expansion Model

PolicyEngine's modular architecture enables deployment across G7 countries:

### Currently Operational
- **United States**: 50 states + federal, 200+ tax and benefit programs
- **United Kingdom**: Complete UK tax-benefit system

### Proven Expansion Path
1. **Partner with local experts**: Collaborate with academics/policy analysts who understand the country's tax code
2. **Encode rules in open-source model**: Typically 3-6 months for core system
3. **Validate with official sources**: Cross-reference government documentation
4. **Deploy and iterate**: Launch beta, gather feedback, expand coverage

### Technical Scalability
- **API-first design**: Other government services can integrate PolicyEngine
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Handles traffic spikes during policy announcements
- **Open source**: Governments can self-host if preferred

## G7 Expansion Potential

| Country | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| United States | Live | Full coverage |
| United Kingdom | Live | Full coverage |
| Canada | Planned | Natural next step given G7 presidency |
| Germany | Feasible | Strong open data availability |
| France | Feasible | Active policy simulation community |
| Italy | Feasible | Interest from policy research community |
| Japan | Requires partnership | Language/documentation barriers |

## Resource Efficiency

PolicyEngine operates lean:
- Small core team (4 FTEs) serving 100K+ users
- Open-source contributions from global community
- Partnerships with universities for country expansion
