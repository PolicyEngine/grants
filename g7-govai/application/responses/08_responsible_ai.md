# Responsible AI

## Alignment with G7 AI Principles

PolicyEngine embodies responsible AI through transparency, accountability, and human-centered design.

### 1. Transparency
- **100% open source**: Every line of code publicly auditable on GitHub
- **Documented methodology**: Clear explanations of how calculations work
- **Reproducible results**: Anyone can verify calculations independently
- **No "black box"**: Users see exactly how their results are computed

### 2. Accountability
- **Version controlled**: Complete history of all changes
- **Cited sources**: Rules reference official legislation and regulations
- **Bug tracking**: Public issue tracker for reporting and fixing errors
- **Community oversight**: Global community of users and contributors

### 3. Privacy by Design
- **No data retention**: Household inputs not stored after calculation
- **No tracking**: No user accounts required for basic functionality
- **Local-first option**: Open source allows fully offline deployment
- **GDPR compliant**: Minimal data collection, clear privacy policy

### 4. Fairness and Inclusion
- **Free access**: No paywalls or premium tiers for core functionality
- **Accessibility**: Web-based, works on any device
- **Multi-language ready**: Architecture supports localization
- **Equity analysis**: Built-in tools to analyze distributional impacts

### 5. Human-Centered Design
- **Empowers users**: Gives citizens information, not decisions
- **Supports human judgment**: Tool for understanding, not automation
- **Iterative feedback**: Regular user research informs development
