Organizations helping Americans access benefits face an infrastructure crisis: no platform connects scattered policy documents into a coherent system. Every caseworker, navigator tool, and research group works with fragments of the policy landscape—unable to see connections across programs or jurisdictions. When Casetext shut down, thousands of legal aid organizations lost document access overnight. This fragmentation forces each organization to solve the same problem separately, wasting resources.

Rules-as-code developers cannot establish authoritative sources for their calculations. While PolicyEngine cites over 2,500 policy URLs, these remain disconnected fragments rather than a semantic system. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator lack direct access to regulatory text behind eligibility determinations—verification requires digging through code rather than referencing documentation. Without a platform connecting computable policies to authoritative documents, tools cannot earn government trust.

The fragmentation also hides critical eligibility pathways. Categorical eligibility chains exist across programs—TANF enables SNAP, SNAP qualifies for Lifeline, LIHEAP unlocks weatherization—but remain invisible in traditional document search. Caseworkers cannot discover these connections systematically, meaning families miss benefits they qualify for because policies aren't computationally linked.

Meanwhile, unclear policy language drives administrative burden costing billions annually. GAO calls complex regulations "inherently error-prone," creating barriers preventing eligible families from accessing benefits. Yet agencies cannot learn which language patterns work because no infrastructure enables comparison across jurisdictions. States repeat mistakes; improvement remains guesswork.

As AI tools increasingly assist with benefit navigation, the lack of authoritative sources becomes critical. Large language models cannot reliably explain benefit rules without verified documentation, limiting their potential to help families.
