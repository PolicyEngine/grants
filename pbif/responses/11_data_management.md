Our data management strategy ensures document integrity, accessibility, and preservation through multiple layers of governance and quality control. Every document entering our system undergoes verification through a transparent GitHub-based review process where human reviewers confirm accuracy of AI extraction, validate document authenticity, and ensure proper metadata attribution. This open review process creates accountability while enabling community contributions and corrections.

Version control forms the foundation of our preservation strategy. Using Git, we maintain complete history of every document change, enabling researchers to access any historical version and track policy evolution over time. Documents are cryptographically hashed to detect any modifications, and our distributed architecture across multiple Git remotes prevents single points of failure. Regular backups to cold storage ensure documents remain available even in catastrophic scenarios.

Data quality metrics guide our continuous improvement process. We track extraction accuracy rates, measuring how often human reviewers must correct AI-identified documents. Response time metrics ensure our API meets performance requirements for production systems. Coverage analysis identifies gaps in our collection, prioritizing jurisdictions or document types needing attention. User feedback loops enable rapid correction of any errors that reach production.

Access control balances openness with security. Read access remains open through our public API, supporting our mission of democratizing policy information. Write access requires authentication and follows strict contribution guidelines. Rate limiting prevents abuse while ensuring legitimate users have reliable access. Usage analytics help us understand access patterns without collecting personally identifiable information about users, maintaining privacy while improving service delivery.
