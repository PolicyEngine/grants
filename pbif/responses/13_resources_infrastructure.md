PolicyEngine Atlas builds on our existing Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, extending proven systems that already serve over 100,000 Americans through our rules engine. GCP provides auto-scaling compute for AI crawlers, Cloud Storage for documents, and managed services reducing operational complexity. Git repositories store documents with version history while GitHub Actions automate testing and deployment.

We're developing Atlas as a public good, accessible by any institution—government or otherwise—through open APIs and source code. Rather than requiring government systems to integrate with us, we provide multiple access methods: REST API for programmatic access, MCP server for AI assistants, web interface for caseworkers, and raw GitHub repositories for transparency. This flexibility lets agencies adopt Atlas at their own pace using their preferred integration approach.

Our outreach focuses on understanding government document management needs. Through partnerships with MyFriendBen's Colorado agency connections and Benefit Navigator's government relationships, we learn how agencies currently manage policy documents and what barriers prevent clearer communication. These insights shape Atlas development, ensuring our open source solution meets real government needs.

The integration with PolicyEngine's encoded rules creates unique value for government. When agencies see their documents connected to actual calculations affecting constituents, they understand how unclear language creates errors. Our semantic layer reveals how their policies interact with other programs, surfacing categorical eligibility pathways they may not realize exist. This combination of document management and rules-as-code demonstrates to agencies how modern infrastructure can reduce administrative burden while improving accuracy for the families they serve.
