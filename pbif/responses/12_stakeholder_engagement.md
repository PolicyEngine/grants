Our stakeholder engagement strategy builds on strong existing partnerships while systematically expanding to serve the entire benefits ecosystem. Research institutions including Georgetown's Better Government Lab, Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, NBER, Urban Institute, and Benefit Kitchen committed to contribute specialized document collections and validate our approach, leveraging their existing benefit rule encodings to strengthen Atlas.

Direct service organizations MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator receive $50,000 subgrants each for demonstration and dissemination. MyFriendBen validates Clarity Index scores across their 3,500 monthly users in Colorado and North Carolina, expanding to Illinois, Massachusetts, and Texas, while leveraging Colorado agency connections to facilitate government adoption. Benefit Navigator integrates Atlas into their Information Hub serving caseworkers across LA County, Riverside, Alameda, DC, Chicago, and New York, demonstrating rules-as-code value through their Riverside County Agentic AI pilot with Nava Labs.

Our bounty program incentivizes experts from trusted organizations like Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit their own documents. Government partners like the Atlanta Federal Reserve integrate our system into their Policy Rules Database. Community advocates contribute through our open GitHub process, ensuring affected populations have direct input.

Continuous feedback loops ensure we remain responsive to user needs. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator provide monthly reports on Atlas integration, error rates, and user feedback. Academic partners share research findings. Government contacts communicate policy changes. This multi-stakeholder approach ensures Atlas serves everyone from individual caseworkers to federal agencies, creating lasting infrastructure for equitable benefit access.
