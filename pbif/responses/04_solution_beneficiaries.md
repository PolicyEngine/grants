PolicyEngine Atlas solves the infrastructure crisis once for everyone. Instead of each organization maintaining separate document libraries, we create a comprehensive, AI-powered archive serving the entire ecosystem. We retrieve, store, and continuously update thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals across 50 states. By integrating with PolicyEngine's proven rules engine, we transform static documents into a semantic knowledge graph revealing program connections, letting organizations stop duplicating effort and focus on helping families.

Rules-as-code developers gain authoritative sources to prove accuracy. PolicyEngine, MyFriendBen, and Benefit Navigator can cite computable policies linked to official documents, while our semantic layer reveals categorical eligibility chains—like TANF enabling SNAP which qualifies for Lifeline—invisible in traditional search. When tools reference exact regulatory text, governments trust them for official use.

Direct service organizations save massive resources through our integrated platform. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator accelerate feature deployment, while caseworkers can verify PolicyEngine's categorical eligibility rules against actual source documents—seeing regulations connecting SSI to Medicaid or SNAP to school meals. The Clarity Index identifies error-causing policy language, helping organizations provide clearer guidance. Our MCP server enables AI assistants to access authoritative sources, preventing hallucination.

Government agencies improve policy communication systematically through the Clarity Index, which analyzes Atlas's archived documents using human expertise and AI to identify error-causing language. When one state's simplified language reduces errors, others adopt those proven approaches through our platform. Strategic subgrants to government-connected organizations ensure these insights become clearer communication—not policy changes—ultimately benefiting families through reduced administrative burden and fewer denials.
