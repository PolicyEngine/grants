We commit to radical transparency and knowledge sharing, ensuring all learnings benefit the entire ecosystem and can be replicated globally.

Strategic subgrants to MyFriendBen ($50k) and Benefit Navigator ($50k) enable real-world demonstration and dissemination. MyFriendBen validates Clarity Index scores across five states while leveraging Colorado agency connections. Benefit Navigator demonstrates rules-as-code value through government partnerships. Both partners generate case studies, validate methodology, and facilitate agency introductions for Atlas adoption.

Our open source approach publishes all code on GitHub under AGPL license in real-time, with comprehensive documentation enabling straightforward deployment anywhere. Weekly development updates keep the community informed while welcoming contributions that strengthen the system. This collaborative environment accelerates innovation beyond what any single organization could achieve.

Research publications share methodological innovations systematically: LLM accuracy benchmark methodology, policy document preservation best practices, partner case studies with quantified impacts, peer-reviewed publications on AI-powered government documentation, and our independent evaluator's comprehensive impact assessment.

Conference presentations reach key audiences: Code for America Summit for civic technologists, APHSA for human services professionals, NAWRS for welfare research, and academic conferences. We'll share findings about RAC acceleration, document preservation, and Clarity Index methodology validated through our demonstration partners.

Community support infrastructure includes monthly office hours, Discord for peer support, quarterly webinars, and an annual virtual summit starting Year 2. Educational resources span video tutorials, template code, university course materials, and policy brief templates.

Impact amplification leverages PolicyEngine's media channels, partner co-marketing, foundation networks, and government associations to ensure learnings reach everyone working to improve benefit access.
