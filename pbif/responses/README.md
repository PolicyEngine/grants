## Word Limits

Each response should be **exactly 250 words** (Â±10% tolerance: 225-275 words).

## Editing Guidelines

1. **Edit individual files** in this directory, not the assembled application
2. **Keep responses focused** - each file addresses one specific question
3. **Use plain markdown** - avoid complex formatting
4. **Count words carefully** - use the assembly script to verify

## Assembling the Application

To combine all responses into the final application:

```bash
cd docs/pbif
python assemble_application.py
```

This will:
- Combine all response files
- Add word counts and validation
- Output to `src/content/pbif-application.md` for the website
- Show which sections need attention

## Word Count Tips

To check word count of a file:
```bash
# Quick check (approximate)
wc -w responses/01_executive_summary.md

# Accurate check (excludes markdown)
python -c "import re; text=open('responses/01_executive_summary.md').read(); print(len(re.sub(r'[#*\-|`\[\]()]', '', text).split()), 'words')"
```

## Status Tracking

The `pbif_questions.yaml` file tracks the status of each response:
- `missing` - File doesn't exist yet
- `needs_update` - Content exists but word count is off
- `needs_formatting` - Content needs restructuring
- `completed` - Ready for submission

## Priority Order

Focus on completing in this order:
1. Missing sections (create new files)
2. Sections with wrong word counts
3. Sections needing formatting updates
