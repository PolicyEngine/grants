PolicyEngine Atlas is at proof of concept stage. We've demonstrated feasibility through collaboration with the Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity, storing 237 federal and North Carolina documents in GitHub repositories (github.com/policyengine/us-sources and github.com/policyengine/us-nc-sources) covering tax credits, SNAP, LIHEAP, TANF, CCDF, Medicaid, and CHIP. This pilot proves document collection works, but the full Atlas system—automated monitoring, Clarity Index, and production API—remains to be built.

Current partners are integrating our pilot repositories. The Atlanta Fed, Georgia Center for Opportunity, and PolicyEngine are now implementing citations to these document collections in our production systems. While not yet live, this validates demand for authoritative sources. Attached letters of support from organizations including Benefit Kitchen and Urban Institute indicate significant benefits of this system. Our interactive mockup demonstrates the envisioned user experience: policyengine.github.io/atlas

PolicyEngine's existing infrastructure enables rapid Atlas development. Congress and top universities use our policy microsimulation tools, we serve over 100,000 Americans through our rules engine, and operate a production API. We've already launched LLM features that explain eligibility rules by combining our rules engine with AI (policyengine.org/us/research/us-household-ai), demonstrating our capability to transform policy documents into accessible explanations. This proven foundation positions us to deploy the full Atlas system within PBIF's 12-month requirement.

Our team brings proven expertise: CEO Max Ghenis and data scientist Ben Ogorek founded Google's People Analytics Data Science team; CTO Nikhil Woodruff built our AI features; economist Pavel Makarchuk directed our US rules engine and the Atlanta Fed/GCO pilot. With PBIF support we'll scale nationwide.
