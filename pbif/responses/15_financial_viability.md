The total budget for PolicyEngine Atlas is $728,907 over two years. With PolicyEngine currently operating at $1 million annually, this grant of $364,454 per year represents approximately 27% of our expanded budget, demonstrating significant but manageable growth that allows continued development of our core rules engine while building Atlas infrastructure.

Budget allocation prioritizes people and partnerships. Personnel costs of $387,500 support 1.3 FTE across five team members. Strategic subgrants totaling $160,000 enable real-world demonstration through MyFriendBen ($50,000), Benefit Navigator ($50,000), Citizen Codex for UX design ($30,000), and an independent evaluator ($30,000). Infrastructure costs of $81,200 cover cloud computing, AI APIs, technical advisory services, search infrastructure, and document verification bounties. Travel and conferences add $5,132, with 15% indirect costs of $95,075.

PolicyEngine's funding trajectory shows strong growth. From our current $1 million budget in 2025, we project reaching $1.68 million in 2026 (68% growth) through confirmed grants: NSF ($200k of $300k total), MyFriendBen ($100k), and Arnold Ventures ($180k of $270k total). By 2027, we project $1.93 million through continued organic growth. This diversification includes NSF grants, Arnold Ventures support, NEO Philanthropy, subgrants from MyFriendBen, Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity, and contracts with Benefit Navigator.

Financial controls ensure responsible stewardship. Monthly reviews track spending against budget, quarterly reports to funders maintain transparency, and board oversight including financial experts guides strategic decisions. This PBIF investment creates lasting infrastructure while maintaining PolicyEngine's financial stability, ensuring Atlas becomes permanent public infrastructure regardless of future funding cycles.
