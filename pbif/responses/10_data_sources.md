Our data sources encompass every publicly available policy document governing safety net programs across federal, state, and local jurisdictions. We systematically collect statutes from legislative websites and the OpenStates API, regulations from agency portals, program manuals containing critical implementation details, memos from departmental archives, and application forms from program websites. Each jurisdiction maintains these documents differently, requiring our AI crawlers to adapt to hundreds of unique website structures and document formats.

The federal layer includes documents from CMS for Medicaid, USDA for SNAP, HHS for TANF, SSA for disability programs, and Treasury for tax credits. State sources span welfare departments, health agencies, workforce development boards, and housing authorities across all 50 states plus DC and territories. Local sources focus on major metropolitan areas with unique benefit programs, particularly counties administering General Assistance or emergency aid programs.

Our collection methodology employs multiple approaches to ensure comprehensiveness. AI-powered crawlers using LLMs perform intelligent extraction, understanding context to identify relevant documents while filtering irrelevant content. Partner contributions from NBER, Urban Institute, and Georgetown provide specialized collections we might miss. Community submissions through GitHub allow corrections and additions from users discovering documents our automated systems haven't found.

Data quality assurance happens at multiple levels. Initial AI extraction undergoes human review for accuracy. Documents are checksummed to detect modifications. Metadata includes source URL, extraction date, and verification status. Version control tracks all changes over time. This multi-layered approach ensures that every document in our system is authentic, current, and properly attributed to its authoritative source.
