## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Crawler failures**: Manual fallback processes, multiple extraction methods
- **Storage scaling**: Cloud architecture designed for 100,000+ documents
- **API performance**: Caching, CDN, and rate limiting strategies

### Operational Risks
- **Partner delays**: Staggered rollout, flexible integration timeline
- **Document access**: Multiple sourcing strategies, FOIA backup plans
- **Quality control**: Multi-tier review process, automated validation

### Financial Risks
- **Cost overruns**: Conservative cloud estimates, reserved capacity
- **Bounty program**: Fixed budgets with clear deliverables
- **Sustainability**: Multiple revenue streams identified
